By Seamus Heaney
Late August, given heavy rain and sun
For a full week, the blackberries would ripen.
At first, just one, a <u>glossy purple</u> clot `Metaphor`
Among others, <u>red, green</u>,<u> hard as a knot.</u> `Simile

You ate that first one and its <u>flesh was sweet </u> `Simile`
<u>Like thickened wine: summer's blood</u> was in it `Personification`
Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for  `Lust = love`
picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger. 

Sent us out with<mark class="hltr-yellow"> milk cans, pea tins, jam pots</mark> 
Where<mark class="hltr-yellow"> briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots. </mark>
Round hay fields, cornfields, and potato drills
We trekked and picked until the cans were full, 
Until the tinkling bottom had been covered

With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned
<u>Like a plate of eyes.</u> Our hands were peppered 
With thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's.

We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre `Hoarded`
But when the bath was filled we found a fur,
A <mark class="hltr-yellow">rat-grey fungus</mark>, glutting on our cache. `Metaphor`
The juice was stinking too. Once off the brush
The fruit fermented, <mark class="hltr-yellow">the sweet flesh would turn sour.</mark>
<mark class="hltr-yellow">I always felt like crying</mark>. It wasn't fair `Upset about summer`
That all the lovely can fulls smelt of rot
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Each year I hoped they'd keep, I knew they would not.</mark> `Childhood is over`



1. I believe that the “we” in this poem refers to Seamus and the reader, as he directly references the reader many times in the poem.

2. Sight – “Heavy rain and sun”, Taste – “its flesh was sweet”, Touch – "Our hands were peppered with thorn pricks”, Smell – “The juice was stinking”, Sound – "Braiars scratched”

3. Sadness - "I always felt like crying.” The author tells the reader how they were sad that the fruit would always rot. Pain - "Our hands were peppered with thorn pricks”, The author talks about how they were in pain after picking the blackberries. Disappointment - `The sweet flesh would turn sour.` The author talks about how they are disappointed that the blackberries would not be ripe and would always turn sour before they would be able to pick them.


1. The poem might be about the sad side of the authors' childhood. They talk about how they wanted to cry, when the blackberries were not ripe, and how they would be in pain after picking them, `Our hands were peppered with thorn pricks.`
2. Using all five senses can help to immerse the reader in the poem and helps to get the point across. So in summary, using all five senses gives the poem a greater meaning and helps to express the author's emotions.
3. I think that they chose blackberries because it was a large part of their childhood I know this because they state that they used to pick blackberries in late August. `Late august, given heavy sun and rain, the blackberries would ripen.`
4. `That all the lovly can fulls smelt of rot, Each year I hoped they'd keep, I knew they would not.`, `A rat grey fungus, glutting our cache.`, `With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned, like a plate of eyes.`
5. The waves crashed along the shore, and the scent of the salty water in the air. I could feel the sand in between my fingers. The sound only the birds and the waves could be heard. I could taste and smell the salty water that was in the air. The ocean was calm, and the birds were calm.
