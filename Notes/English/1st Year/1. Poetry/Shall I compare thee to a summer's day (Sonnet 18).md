Shall I compare thee to a summer’s <mark class="hltr-red">day</mark>?
Thou art more lovely and more <mark class="hltr-pink">temperate</mark>:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of <mark class="hltr-red">May</mark>,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a <mark class="hltr-pink">date</mark>;

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven <mark class="hltr-orange">shines</mark>,
And often is his gold complexion <mark class="hltr-yellow">dimm'd</mark>;
And every fair from fair sometime <mark class="hltr-orange">declines</mark>,
By chance or nature’s changing course <mark class="hltr-yellow">untrimm'd</mark>;

But thy eternal summer shall not <mark class="hltr-green">fade</mark>,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou <mark class="hltr-cyan">ow’st</mark>;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his <mark class="hltr-green">shade</mark>,
When in eternal lines to time thou <mark class="hltr-cyan">grow’st</mark>:

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

### What I saw.

I saw a field with a tree, as well as flowers. I also saw a dock with a small sailboat. And only a few clouds in the sky.
