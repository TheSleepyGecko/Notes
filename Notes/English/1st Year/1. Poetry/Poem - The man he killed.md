Had he and I but <mark class="hltr-orange">met</mark>
By some ancient <mark class="hltr-red">inn</mark>,
We should have set us down to <mark class="hltr-orange">wet</mark>
Right many a <mark class="hltr-red">nipperkin</mark>!

<mark class="hltr-green">But ranged as</mark> <mark class="hltr-red">infantry</mark><mark class="hltr-green">,</mark>
And staring face to <mark class="hltr-orange">face</mark>,
I shot at him as he at <mark class="hltr-red">me</mark>,
and killed him in his <mark class="hltr-orange">place</mark>.
I shot him dead <mark class="hltr-red">because</mark>-
Because he was my <mark class="hltr-orange">foe</mark>.
Just so; my foe of course he <mark class="hltr-red">was</mark>;
That's clear enough; <mark class="hltr-orange">although</mark>

He thought he'd 'list, <mark class="hltr-red">perhaps</mark>,
Off-hand like--just as <mark class="hltr-orange">I</mark>-
Was out of work--had sold his <mark class="hltr-red">traps</mark>-
No other reason <mark class="hltr-orange">why</mark>.

Yes; quaint and curious war is!
You shoot a fellow <mark class="hltr-red">down</mark>
You'd treat, if met where any bar is,
Or help to half a <mark class="hltr-red">crown</mark>.

Rhyming words = <mark class="hltr-red">Words</mark> or <mark class="hltr-orange">Words</mark>
Simile = <mark class="hltr-green">Words</mark>
