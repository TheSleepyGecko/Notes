Good afternoon, Ratoath college. My name is Michael Cummins. Today, I would like to discuss the topic of why homework should be banned with you. There are many reasons to why homework should be banned, but I will discuss just three today. These points are what homework achieves, why it is unnecessary, and much better alternatives. 

Firstly homework tries to improve understanding of a given topic, this sometimes work, but we can see that in schools where students spend less time in school and with no homework can be much more successful. Take Finland as an example, they are regarded as one of the best or the best education systems in the world. They have less homework and spend fewer hours in school. I think that our schools should learn from this and adapt their teachings to improve the happiness and grades that students can achieve.
