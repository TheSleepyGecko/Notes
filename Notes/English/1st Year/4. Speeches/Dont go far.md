1. Hello mother, may I please borrow 5 euro.
2. Hello there, could I quickly borrow 5 euro, I will make sure to pay it back.
3. Excuse me, officer, but I am in desperate need of 5 dollars.
4. Hello, excuse me there, but I desperately require a 5 euro note, do you think you could help me out.

I think that active listening means that you are thinking and taking down key details or reconsidering ideas.

1. Keith Burn, 13, Noah Murray, 10.
2. Sneaking on to the train and telling the officer that their mother is behind and will catch up soon.
3. The boys told the policeman the truth because they realized that they were so far away from home and their family and friends would be worried about them, and they wanted to go home.
4. I think that Keith is very smart, independent and shows leadership. I think he is smart because he talks about how he was smarter than the other children his age, and he was able to stowaway all the way to America. In my opinion, I think that he is very independent because he is able to journey around different countries on his own. I think that he shows leadership because he tells Noah what to do and how to get around on planes or steal from shops.
5. I think that the documentary is very effective. The documentary summarized everything that happeded which helped to get the point across. It finishes any unanswered questions such as what happened in their later lives and what their parents did and what changes were made.
6. I think it is called “Don't go far” because his mother tells him not go far, before he became a stowaway on a train and managed to get to America.
7. I enjoyed the storytelling in this documentary. On the other hand, I dislike the pace and think that they have skipped over important details and spent longer on irrelevant ones.
8. He hid the money in his sock.
9. When they arrived at the police station, the boys see a detective with a gun, the boys then asked if they could hold his gun because they have never seen a gun before in their lives.
10. The police officers stopped joking with the boys because it was a serious security issue because they were able to stowaway on a plane.
