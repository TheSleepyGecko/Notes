#### The Colonel
I am currently reading a novel called "Privite Peaceful" by Michael Morpurgo. One of the main characters of this book is called the Colonel. <mark class="hltr-yellow">He is a very mean spirited character/man who comes across as very **aggressive, strict** and **nosey.**</mark> There are several examples in the book so far that clearly shows us just how mean he is.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We first see a very aggrsesive side to the Colonel when he catches the Peaceful boys poaching on his land.</mark> As a way to bring some extra food into the Peacful household, Charlie and Tommo would regularly fish on the Colonel's land. However, one evening Tommo fell asleep while on watch and this resulted in them being caught. The Colonel was outraged/furious with the thieving boys. <mark class="hltr-green">He told them he would "give each of them the hiding they so richly deserve".</mark><mark class="hltr-cyan">This seems like an extremly **aggressive** thing to do to two young children. </mark>Thankfully mother stepped in and renegotiated the punishment to kennel cleaning duty.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The Colonel is also a very **strict** man. He likes things to be done in a very specific way</mark> which dosen't always make sense. One such example is when we are told that he makes Molly iron out his newspaper each and every morning before he reads it. <mark class="hltr-green">We are told "He insistd his newspaper should be crisp and dry so the ink should not come onto his fingers."</mark> <mark class="hltr-cyan">I think this is a very unusual task/rule to enforce upon Molly wether she wanted to do it or not.</mark>

<mark class="hltr-yellow">We have seen that the Colonel is a very nosey and demanding man.</mark> He is always getting up in everyones business and demanding them to do what he says, we see an example of this <mark class="hltr-green">when he talks to Molly's parents and tells them that the peaceful family are thieves and criminals, and that Molly should not talk to any of them.</mark> <mark class="hltr-cyan">This ruins the friendship between Molly, Tommo and Charlie and that was not his decision to make, he should have let Molly's parents decide. </mark>
