Dear Molly**

It is horrible here. It is cold and dark, there used to be rainfall every day and mud everywhere but not anymore. How is life back home hopefully there is not rainfall back there as well. It is infested here as well rats, mice, and lice everywhere and somehow, they are surviving this horrible winter. It is terrifying here in the trench’s gunshots every day and you never get to sleep, how are you back home I hope you are doing well, and mother is too. I am scared I just went across no-man’s land and captured one of the soldiers terrifying, he is with us now. I hope you made some new friends back home as well.

I made a lot of new friends and Charlie has as well. I met Little Les, Pete and Nipper and he is the only reason we have been controlling the rat infestation. We have a new leader Captain Wilkes, and he is much nicer than sergeant horrible Hanley, he sings songs with us to keep up our morale and it really works. Over here we called the Hun the Fritz, and they are just like us, I still do not know why we are fighting them.

All the good things aside, I hate it here I guess the only word to describe this would be home sick. I hope you are doing good, and mother and big Joe are as well. It lonely out here as well I am always on sentry duty on my own in the dark. But at least captain Wilke was nice while he was still here, but he is gone now.

Charlies is doing all right, or it seems that way. He has been the only person holding us together, stopping us from giving up, keeping us motivated. He seems sad that captain Willkie is gone he was especially important to him. But not everything is bad, captain Willkie left Charlie a pocket watch and he loves it! He is worried about the baby, but he does not like to talk about it.
