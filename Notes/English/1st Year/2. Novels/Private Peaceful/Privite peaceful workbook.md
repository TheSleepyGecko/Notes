1. After the funeral for beartha big Joe was extremly sad, we know this because he stayed out there all night. He did this because he wanted to stay and mourn the death of one of his best friends.

2. The first place the family decided to look for big Joe was down at the orchard where the funeral had taken  place, after there was no sign of him there they decided to look down the lane as far as the brook. Then they went to the church yard and still with no sign of him, Molly had the great idea to look at the top of the church tower, where Tommo found him.

3. I think that the town was so greatly affacted because big Joe was a friend to many of the citizens. He would help out around town, and he was extremely friendly.

4. Big Joe was gone for an entire day, scaring his family and everybody else in the town.

5. When Molly realised that he thought that beartha would be up at the top of the church because it was the highest point in the village, and he thought it was heaven. So they  finally decided to go up and check there.

6. When Tommo was heading up to the top of the church he felt cold and scared, as he remembered all those days he had been those before.
