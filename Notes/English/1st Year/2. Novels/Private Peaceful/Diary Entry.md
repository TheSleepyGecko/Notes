Its so cold in the trenches no warm soup to warm me up, but I remember it like yesterday those, cold winters in Grandma wolf's house during the winter I could never sleep in those thin, small, beds with those tiny blankets.

When I couldn't sleep I would creep downstairs and try to take some of the sweets but Grandma wolf always caught me and would give me last nights soup which she would warm up in the pot, then she would scold me for wasting tomorrows  lunch and send me back to bed. In those cold winter nights I didn't appreciate it but I do now, I would sulk in the corner and drink the soup as she lectured me about the importance of not letting perfectly good food go to waste, but I never listened. 

But when she didn't catch me I would look around for sweets I could take, and in the morning she would tell me about how bad those pesky rats are and how they would eat all her food and she had to throw it out, because nobody would want to eat it, and then throw it out after she told us "You will regret wasting food when your older", then we had to convince her to let us have lunch because we had wasted some food.

I could never appreciate how she was just trying to help us, but we never listened I still long for those days where I could just go to my bed and eat the brilliant potato and carrot soup instead of these small soggy biscuits and canned vegetables. ***ðŸ’¥Explosion sound!ðŸ’¥*** What is that sound I haven't heard people in days, I need to hide quickly...
