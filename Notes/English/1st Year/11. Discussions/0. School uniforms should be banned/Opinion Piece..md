### 1. Introduction
Should school uniforms be banned? I am making the arguement that yes, school uniforms should be banned. School uniforms even though neccesary to school life they can be uncomfortable, inconvenient, expensive, they do not allow people to express themselves and somwhat disgusting.

### 2. Body
Firstly, they can be seen as uncofortable by many students because they can be restricting, itchy and cold. School uniforms can be extremely expensive from the fact that there are many pieces of the uniform and each piece may have to be tailored for specific students. Uniforms completely limit student's creativity, the only creative freedom is on P.E day when you can wear whatever shoes you would like. Many students also think that uniforms can be disgusting, because unless you buy two uniforms adding to the already expensive outfit, you cannot wash the uniform and have to wear it all week.

### 3. Conclusion
In conclusion I think that the school uniform should be banned because it is expensive, disgusting, uncofortable and limit students creativity. In my opinion I think that this is a very good arguement for why the uniform should be changed or banned entirely. I hope that the princepal Mr. Meehan will act upon this and take action to the liking of the regular students and the students on th student council.

Sincerely Michael
