| I know that drama is when you act to interpret scenes or stories.                    | I want to know what happens behind the scenes. |                |
| I know that you must display the most fitting emotions for the scene you are acting. | I want to know about stage positions.          |                |
| I know you must follow a script.                                                     |                                                |                |

I like going to the cinema because I get to watch a movie soon after it comes out, I can relax and enjoy it more than I would at home.
