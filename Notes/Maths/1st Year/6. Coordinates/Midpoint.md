When you draw a line between two points, for example A(2, 1) and B(6, 5) you may need to find the midpoint. The midpoint is denoted by the letter M and is the very center of the line.

The formula to find the mid-point is to add the two x values divide by two, then add the two y values and divide by two.

```math
M = (A[x] + B[x])/2 (A[y] + B[y])/2

M = (2+6)/2 (1+5)/2 = (4, 3)
```
