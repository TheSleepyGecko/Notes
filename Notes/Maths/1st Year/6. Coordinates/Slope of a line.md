When you are given a slope in coordinate geometry, you may need to find out how steep the slope is. To find the slope, you must find the length of the slope by subtracting the two x coordinates. You must also find the climb, so subtract the two y coordinates.

In our example the length is 6 and the climb is 3, so you divide the climb by the length, and you get 2 which is how many meters you would have to walk to climb up one meter. If you would like to represent this as a percentage, you divide your answer S by 100, and we are left with 50%.

```math

S = (A[x]-B[x])/(A[y]-B[y]) = 2

100/S = 50

```

Remember that you can have negative slopes. Slopes that go from left to right and are rising is a rising slope(positive) and one that is going the same direction and is going down is negative.
