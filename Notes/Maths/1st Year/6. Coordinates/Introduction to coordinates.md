Coordinates are a method of finding the location of a point on a grid. This grid is called the Cartesian plain. Coordinates are denoted by two variables x and y and z if you are in 3d. It is written like this (x, y).

The center of this grid is denoted by x = 0, y = 0 or (0, 0). X is the horizontal plane so going across the grid and Y is the vertical plane going up and down. Going up increases the y variable, and going down decreases it. Going right increases the x variable, and going left decreases it.

The four sections shown in the above diagram are called quadrants. Some coordinate diagrams will only have one quadrant, which is only positive x and y. As an example on how coordinates work, these are the answers to the above diagram. A = (3, 2) B = (-2, 2) C = (-3, -2) D = (4, -3)

The center of the grid is called the origin point and is denoted with (0, 0)
