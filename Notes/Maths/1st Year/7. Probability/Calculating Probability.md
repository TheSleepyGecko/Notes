For equally likely outcomes to find the outcome of an event
you do `Number of favourable outcomes / Numbers of possible outcomes
A favorable outcome is an outcome that you want.

For example if you want to roll a 1 on a die the probability is 1/6 because the 1/(1,2,3,4,5,6)

example 2 = roll an even number on a die (2,4,6)/(1,2,3,4,5,6) = 1/2
