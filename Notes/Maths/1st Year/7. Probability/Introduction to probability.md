Outcomes are all the possible answers or results from the test. When you roll a die there is 6 possible outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

If you toss a coin and then roll a die, the list of possible outcomes is 12 because you must multiply them for both so 2 × 6

H₁ H₂ H₃ H₄ H₅ H₆
T₁ T₂ T₃ T₄ T₅ T₆

|     | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H   | H,1 | H,2 | H,3 | H,4 | H,5 | H,6 |
| T   | T,1 | T,2 | T,3 | T,4 | T,5 | T,6 | 

This is called the fundamental law of counting, where when you want to find the probability, you can multiply the two numbers. It will tell you how many possible outcomes you can have.

For example, if you went to a restaurant and there are M choices for starters and N choices for main courses, you can have M × N meals.

If M = 2 and N = 3 then the number of different meals is equal to 6!

### Probability scale

- Probability is measured from 0 ⇾ 1.
- The closer the probability is to zero, the more unlikely it is to happen.
- The closer it is to 1 the more likely it is to happen.

### Equally, likely outcomes

An equally likely outcomes are outcomes that all have the same probability of ocouring. Ex. Heads or Tails, Red Card in a deck, A die is rolled.
