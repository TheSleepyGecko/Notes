### LCM - Lowest Common Multiple
This means we will have to list of multiples of more than one number and we will have to find the lowest number is common between the multiple.

E.g. 

The lowest common multiple of 3,7

3 = {3,6,9,12,15,18,21...}

7 = {7,14,21...}

So the LCM of 3 & 7 is 21.

The lowest common multiple of 2, 4, 8

2 = {2,4,6,8...}

4 = {4,8...}

8 = {8...}

LCM = 8.

The lowest common multiple of 3, 4, 6

3 = {3,6,9,12...}

4 = {4,8,12...}

6 = {6,12...}

LCM = 12
