### Commutative.
- Order of operations dose not matter (This means we get the same answer no matter the order)
- Only happens for two operations.
- Lets see if we can figure out which ones work...

Eg.
```math
4+6 = 10
6 + 4 = 10


6-4 = 2
4-6 = -2

2*3 = 6
3*2 = 6

6/3 = 2
3/6 = 0.5
```
The only two things that are commutative are addition and muliplacation.

### Associative
- Here no matter where we place barackets we will still get the same answer.
- This only works for two properites/operations
- Lets see f we can figure out which...

```math
2+(3+4) = 9
(2+3)+4 = 9
(2+3+4) = 9

2*(3*4) = 24
(2*3)*4 = 24
(2*3*4) = 24

10-(4-3) = 1
(10-4)-3 = 3
(10-4-3) = 3

24/(2/4) = 12
(24/2)/4 = 3
(24/2/4) = 3
```
So Addition and Multiplacation are both asscoiative.
