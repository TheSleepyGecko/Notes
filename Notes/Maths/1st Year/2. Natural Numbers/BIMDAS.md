BIMDAS or order of operations tell us in which order to do our equations so for
example...
```math
1+({6*3}/2)-3
```
And BIMDAS says that we must do

Brackets fist then

Indices then

Multiplication then

Division then

Addition and finally 

Subtraction

so the answer to the question is 7

#### Indices and fractions
Indices means powers.
```math
2^2 -> 5*5*5 = 125 
```
A Fractions line means divide, this is a little different you ==must== simplify the numerater and denominater first.
