**Factors** are two numbers that you can multiply together to get to the base number so for example.

The **Factors** of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8 because those are the only numbers that can be multiplied together to get to 8
Another word for **Factors** is dividers but they mean the same thing.

**More Examples**
`18` {1,2,3,6,9,18}

`36` {1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36}

`52` {1,2,4,13,26,52}
