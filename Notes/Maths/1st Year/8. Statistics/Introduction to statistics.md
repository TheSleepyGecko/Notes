>[!Statistics]
>Statistics is the study of information to make good presumptions.

Presumptions are guesses made with information(data) and assumptions are guesses made without data.

- Data can be gathered in multiple ways. If you gather the data yourself it is known as primary data, or if somebody else gathers the data it is known as secondary data.

### Types of Data

**Categorical Data:**
- Data that can be divided into specific groups
- Category forms

Example: Gender, Colours, Division

**Numerical Data:**
- Data which can be counted or measured
- Number forms

Example: Goals scored, Temperature, Speed


### Population
Population is everything or everyone that can be included in the survey.

### Sampling
Sampling is a selection (subset) of data from a larger group of data.

### Bias
If the sample is not random and does not fairly represent the population, the results may be bias.
