When multiplying intgers you first need to count the amount of negitive numbers in the equation. If the amount of negitive numbers in the equation is even then you know that the answer will be positive and you can multiply the numbers regularly. If the number of negitive numbers in the equation is odd then you know the result will be negitive, so you can multiply the numbers and make the result negitive.

```math
-3 * 4 = -12
4 * 2 = 8
-8 * -2 = 16
-2 * 3 * -4 = 24
```
