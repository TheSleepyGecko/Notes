A set is a collection of objects or ideas. These can be numbers, names, objects, or even things such as 'odd numbers'. A set has to be definable, so you cannot create a set of 'good songs' but you can create a set of 'songs made after 2000'. Sets are usually inside curly brackets and are denoted by an uppercase letter. `Example set A = {1, 3, Banana, Jerry}`

The objects of ideas which make up a set are called elements and are denoted by ∈, elements are separated by commas. Smaller parts of sets are called subsets and denoted by ⊂.
