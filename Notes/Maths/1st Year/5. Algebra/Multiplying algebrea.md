- When we multiply, and we have the same base, we add the powers. An example of this is if we did x^2 * x^3 = x^5.

```math
(a^10)(a^5) = a^15
(a)(a) = a^2
(x)(x) = x^2
```
### Rules

- When we see brackets, we multiply. But when we multiply we have to follow a rule called **SNL** which stands for **Signs**, **Numbers**, **Letters**.
