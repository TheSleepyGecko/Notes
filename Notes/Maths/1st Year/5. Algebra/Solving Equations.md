An equation always has to be balanced, which means that both sides of the equal sign will equal to the same amount.

On an exam there may be a diagram like a weighting scales, and it might say this.

🔺= 🟥🟥
Find 🔺 if 🟥 is equal to 6.

We can see that one triangle is equal to 2🟥, which means that if you multiply the value of the 🟥 by 2 to balance it we can see that the triangle is equal to 12.

🔺🔺= 🟥
Find 🟥 if 🔺 is equal to 4.

🟥 = 8

🟥🟥🟥 = 🔺🔺

🔺 = 12

this one is more difficult but can be solved via the same method as before

🔺* 2 = 24

🟥🟥🟥 = 24

24 / 3 = 8

🟥 = 8

20. 5

Remember when you are balancing an equation to take your time. This is an equation solved in detail (HARD).

3x + 7 = 32 – 2x

The first step is to remove the “+ 7” and once you remove it you remove seven on the other as well, and you are left with.

3x = 25 – 2x

So now we know that 25 = 5x because "- 2x" = "3x" so then you divide by 5 and you now know that x = 5
