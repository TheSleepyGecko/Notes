- Translating english to maths. "Think of a number" means that you need to think of a variable, x.
	- Less than = Subtracting
	- More than = Addition
	- is = Equals
	- Double = Multiply by 2
	- Triple = Multiply by 3

1. 
	i) 2 bigger than x = x + 2
	ii) 4 bigger than x = x + 4
	iii) 3 less than x = x - 3
	iv) 10 less than x = x - 10
	v) 14 more than x = x + 14
	vi) twice x = x * 2
	vii) five times x = x * 5
	viii) 2 greater than twice x = (x * 2) + 2

An equation is a sum with an equals which means that we can sove it and find the missing variables.

2. Write an equation for the following 
	i) I think of a number, I add 6, the result is 12. What is the number? **6**
	ii) I think of a number, I subtract 7, the result is 10. What is the number? **17**
	iii) I think of a number, I double it, the result is 14. What is the number? **7**
	iv) I think of a number, I double it and then add 5, the result is 19. **7**

4. 
	i) I think of a number my result is nine. x + 4 = 9
	ii) I think of a number and I subtract eight, my result is four. x - 8 = 4
	v) I think of a number, I double it and than add three my result is 13. 2x + 3 = 13
