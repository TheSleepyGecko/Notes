Evaluation always means that you must find the value of a variable or sum. The answer when you are asked to evaluate somthing will always be a number. In these question where we need to evaluate things we are also always told the vaules of all the variables
**Example:**
```math
x = 3
y = 2

3x + 2y = 13

Steps:
3x+ 2y
3(3) + 2(y)
9 + 4
13

x = -2
y = 4

3x + y = -2

Steps:
3x + y
3(-2) + (4)
-6 + 4
-2

x = -3
y = 4

3xy = -36

Steps:
3xy
3(x)(y)
3(-3)(4)
3(-12)
-36

x^2 + y = 13

Steps:
x^2 + y
-3^2 + 4
9 + 4
13

```
Remember the rule that when brackets are side by side that means multiply.
