To add algebra you have to look for like terms. Like terms are two terms in the equation which have the same varible and same power, if you have no variable attachted and they are the same power they are still considered like terms.

Once you have identifed the like terms you must add them with the symbol accsiated with them e.g.

<mark class="hltr-red">5x</mark> <mark class="hltr-orange">- 7y</mark> <mark class="hltr-red">+ 4x</mark>

And then to simplify this expression you can see the like terms in red. The 4x has a + attached which means we add it with our other like term. And once we do that we are left with.

<mark class="hltr-red">9x </mark><mark class="hltr-orange">- 7y</mark>
