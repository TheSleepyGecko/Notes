### Expanding brackets
When removing brackets you must multiply everything inside the brackets so that the brackets are not needed. You must multiply the number on the outside by every term on the inside. e.g.

```math
3(2+5)
3(2) + 3(5)
6 + 15
21
```
**RULE:** Everything on the outisde will be multiplied by everything on the inside.
