Algebra is a form of maths which allows letters to be interpreted as numbers.

### Variables
Variables are the names for these numbers. A variable will always fall into two categories **Known** or **Unknown**. Known means that we know the number or equation that the letter stands for so we can use it in our sums. Unknown means we do not yet know the value of the variable and will have to figure it out with other evidence.

a = 8
B = 6
a² + b² = c²
is probably the most common example of variables being used. If we want to know  the value of C which is currently unknown we will have to add A² + B² which are known in this example. The answer to this question would be 64 + 36 = 100 and then you find the square root of the answer which is 10. So C is 10

### Coefficient

Variables can be multiples when you put a number beside them. Using our example from earlier if we do 4b that means  4 * b which would be 24 so 4b is equal to 24 we call this answer a constant because it will not change.

Coefficient is the number beside the variable which we discussed in the previous paragraph.

### Constants

Constants are numbers which do not change they are numbers with no variables attached.

### Expression

Any sum which does not have an = is called an expression. When we are dealing with expression we can not find an answer because our variable is **Unknown**, but we can add and subtract or do any process to this variable.

These expressions can not be solved but can be simplified which means to make as small as possible.

If we went to Katy's and we put in this order.

chips, chips, chips, chips, chick N, chick N and chick N

it would not make any sense so it is better to simplify it and do.

4 Chips + 4 Chick N

but this will only work if the are **like terms** this means the letters are the same and the power must also be the same. We call each part of our expression a term

3x+7 + k -5Y
