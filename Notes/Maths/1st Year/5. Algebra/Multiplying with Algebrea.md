- When you multiply algebrea you add the power. Remember like terms are two numbers which share the same variable and power.

**Examples:**

```math
x(x - 3)
x^2 - 3x
```
- The method to get these answers is to multiply the like terms and remember your plus and minus rules. There are many more examples of this in the maths homework folder from the dates around december and november 2022.
