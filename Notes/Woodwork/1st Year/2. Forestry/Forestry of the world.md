##### Deforestation 

- Deforestation is the destruction of large forest areas without replanting the trees cut down. Timber is a renewable resource only when it is managed properly and trees are replanted when they are cut down.

- In tropical regions, forests are being cut down and not being replanted. It is estimated that areas the size of Ireland are being lost each year.

##### Reasons for Deforestation

- Large areas cleared for farming and ranching. (slash and burn technique). High demand for tropical hardwood.
- Natives of some regions use timber as an economical source of fuel for heating and cooking. Commercial interests of large multinational and local logging companies.

##### Effects of Deforestation

- Slash and burning methods kill all animals, birds, and insects living in the trees, causing many to become extinct. Burning of trees contributes to air pollution.

- The number of trees available to consume CO2 and produce O2 is reduced, causing the greenhouse effect. Effects weather and the global climate.

- Increases soil erosion in deforested areas. Native tribes are removed from their home. Floodingâ€”as tree consume large amounts of water, their removal can cause the later level to rise.

##### How to prevent Deforestation

- Only use tropical wood that are grown in managed forests (for each tree cut down, one or more is replanted). Where possible, use manufactured boards rather than solid tropical hardwoods. Try to recycle wood and wood products, 
- E.g. paper.
