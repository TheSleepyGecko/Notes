| Low cost and fast.                                          | Not suitable for structural timber.                                                                                                           |
| Maximum width of planks obtained from the log.              | With this method, cupping caused by tangential shrinkage is a problem. (cupping is the warping of the plank away from the heart of the tree.) |
| Little waste.                                               |                                                                                                                                               |
