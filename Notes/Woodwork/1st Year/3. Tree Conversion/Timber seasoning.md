### Reasons for seasoning
- Seasoning is the controlled process of reducing the moisture content of the timber so that it is suitable for the environment and intended use. Wood will dry naturally, so seasoning helps us to control the process and keep the timber more stable and more useful.
- Seasoning, prevents splitting, fungal and insect attacks. It is less likely to distort or warp later. After seasoning timber is easier to work with, because it is lighter, harder, and stronger. The timber is easier to cut and plane and won't clog machine blades.


### Methods of seasoning

##### Natural/Air Seasoning
**Advantages:**
- No expensive equipment needed
- Small labor cost once stack is made
- Environmentally friendly â€“ uses little energy

**Disadvantages**
- Slow drying rate
- Large area of space required
- Only dries the timber to approximately 20% moisture content

The stickers create a gap so that air can pass all the way inbetween the pieces of wood.

##### Kiln Seasoning

- The kiln is a single-enclosed container or building. The timber is stacked in the same manner as air seasoning.
- The whole stack is seasoned using a program of setting(temperature and humidity) until the entire stack has the desired moisture content.

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| - Boards dry faster                                        | - Costly to set up and run                    |
| - Lower moisture content below 10%                         | - Uses a lot of heat for long periods of time |
| - Greater control over the drying process                  | - Requires a trained operator                 | 
| - Different thickness of board and different types of wood |                                               |
| - Defects can be minimized                                 |                                               |
