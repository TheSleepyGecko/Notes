- Trees are cut down during winter as there is less growth, therefore less sap. After felling, trees are transported to sawmills to be cut into boards.

- This process of converting logs to boards is known as conversion. There are 3 methods of conversion.
	- Through and through, sawing.
	- Tangential sawing.
	- Quarter sawing.
