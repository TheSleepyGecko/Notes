##  Function of various parts

- **Roots** - anchor the tree and absorb moisture and minerals from the soil.
- **Trunk** - supports the branches and is the main source of wood we use
- **Bark** - protects the wood on the inside from attack
- **Leaves** - used to produce food for the tree to grow

## How trees grow

Trees have two ways they can grow one of these methods is by **Seeds** and the other is **Cutting**.

#### Seeds can be scattered by main means.

- Some simply drop from the tree and land on the ground.
- Some are dispersed by the wind.
- Others are carried away by animals and birds.

#### Cutting
Cutting a stem or branch is taken from an existing tree and is replanted in a warm humid environment. It should eventually develop roots and survive as a growing tree.

#### How a tree grows from a seed.
- After some time the seed **germinates**. It requires moisture and warmth. The seed itself contains the food necessary for germination.
- After germination the **radical** grows down into the soil.
- Then the **plumule** grows towards the surface as the first leaves from, plant is now called a seedling.
