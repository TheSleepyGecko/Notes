The branches and the leaves are supported by the trunk kepping them off the ground. The trunk contains the majority of the wood. Both the trunk and the branches are covered in bark. As moisture evaporates from the leaves, sap carryinf water and nutrients from the soil is drawn up through the trunk.

#### Bark
The bark is the outer protective skin of the tree. It is tough and it protects the wood from damage by the wather, animals, insects and fungi. It helps to keep moisture in the tree.

#### Bast (phloem)
The **Bast** is the layer of cells just inside the bark. This layer of cells channels food in the form of sap (sugar and nutrients dissolved in water) down from the leaves to the rest of the tree.

#### Cambium layer
This thin layer of cells between the bast and the sapwood is where the growth of the tree takes place. Cells are added to the outer layer to from the annual rings. These xylem cells then carry water and minerals up from the roots to the leaves.

#### Sapwood
This is the lighter coloured wood. Each year layers of cells are added to the outside of the **sapwood**. Cells carry water and nutrients up and down the trunk nourishing the tree. The sapwood is lighter, softer and less durable.

#### Heartwood
The **Heartwood** is located in the centre of the tree usually darker in colour. It gives support and is the oldest inactive part of the tree. The heartwood is more durable and is resistent to insect and fungal attacks.

#### Ray Cells
Ray cells radiate out from the centre of the trunk. They move sap between the centre and outside of the trunk. These ray cells are clearly seen in oak as **silver grain**, when it is cut radially.

#### Pith
This soft spongy material is at the centre of the trunk. It is the remains of the young tree.

#### Annual rings.
Trees in the temperate areas of the world grow with the seasons. Each year a ring of cells is added; during spring and summer the growth is rapid and cells are wider, during the autumn and winter the cells there is less growth so the cells are smaller and more compact. Counting the annual rings allows us to estimate the age of a tree.
