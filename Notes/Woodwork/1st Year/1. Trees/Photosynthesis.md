**Photosynthesis** - Water and carbon dioxide in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll cause a chemical reaction to make glucose and oxygen

- Leaves take in C02 from the air through tiny pores called the stomata.
- Green colouring in leaves is called chlorophyll.
- Sun shines on chlorophyll in presence of C02 + H20 causes a chemical reaction called Photosynthesis.
- Photosynthesis produces glucose (food for the tree) and oxygen.
