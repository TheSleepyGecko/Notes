### Ask the agony aunt

Hello Olaf, I think that you should stop your training after school because you are not enjoying it and there is not much purpose to continue it. You could organize your time so that you could, can do your homework more effectively. You could also go to the after school study with your friends so that you could do your homework and meet up with your friends.

Friends should be loyal, honest and some people, struggle to make friends.
