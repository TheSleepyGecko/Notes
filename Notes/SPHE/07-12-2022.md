### The danger zone. 

##### We agree that the four most risky situations are.

1. **Being robbed or mugged:** This is a risky situation because you could get hurt, killed or become homeless.
2. **Being threatened or alone:** This is a very risky situtation because they could leak sensitive information, or stalk you.
3. **Fighting on the street:** If this happened you could be humiliated, sent to hospital or be bullied.
4. **Getting money from an ATM machine while someone you dont know is watching you behind your shoulder:** This is dangerous because they could steal your Debit card information. And then they could threaten you to do something or they could even spend your money or put you in debt.
