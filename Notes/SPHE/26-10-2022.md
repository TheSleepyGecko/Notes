### Being healthy
What being healthy means to me that you are mentaly, physicaly, and scocialy well. Mentaly well means to me that you are happy, not being bullied, and are accepting of your life. Physicaly well means to me that you are possibly doing sports or working out or just even playing with your friends, and that you are keeping you body well. Scocialy well means that you have good realtions with people in your class and you have nice friends or even just having good relations at home.
