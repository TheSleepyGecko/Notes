| The right to education      | I think that the right to education is very important because you will be able to survive and thrive in life. |
| The right to food and water | I think that it is important because you will die.                                                            |
| The right to free speach    | This is important because if there are things that you may have things that you want heard or if you are being abused you can tell people.                                                                                                              |

1. I think that leisure is not that essential, because it is not nessacary for survival and some people are forced to live without it.

I think that parents, guardians, police or government should try to protect children's rights.
