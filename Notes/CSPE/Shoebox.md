I found a shoebox in my house which is the one that I chose to decorate, After I had put the gifts into the shoebox. I decorated the shoebox in blue christmas wrapping paper. And after I had secired the wrapping paper with tape I was finished decorating the box!

One of the things I found difficult was finding a shoebox, because there was none we could buy and it was very hard to find one in my house, but I did manage to find it in the end.

In my shoebox I put a set of 3 toothbrushes so that they could maintain good dental health, and I also thought that it would be useful. I put a tube of toothpaste into the shoebox so they would be able to use that along with the toothbrush. I also put a set of marbles into the shoebox so that they could have something to enteratain them and they could also share them with their friends or with their family because there was a large amount of marbles in the shoebox. I also put a few pieces of clothing that they would be able to use, and I thought it would be very useful to them.

I think that this is one of the best and most heartfelt way that someone could support a charity because they can custimze the box so that it is more special, and also makes you feel good every year when you do it.

Somthing I would do diffrently about the shoebox appeal is the amount of gifts I put in the shoebox. I would consider maybe putting more items into my shoebox next year.
