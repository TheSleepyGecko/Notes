### Martin Luther King Jr.

Martin Luther King Jr. Is the son of Martin Luther King, who was also a human rights activist. He fought for the rights of African Americans from the years 1957 to 1968. He decided that he would preform non-violent protests to fight for human rights. His first protest was the bus boycott. He would travel on different buses around America to fight against segregation on public transport and human rights issues. He traveled over 6 million miles across America and gave his speech 2,500 times. This along with his iconic 'I have a dream' speech. It earned him the title of the youngest person to ever receive a Nobel Peace Prize and start a movement that would put a stop to segregation and allow African Americans to be treated the same as every one else. But he was assassinated in 1968 for his beliefs, but his message is still talked about today.
