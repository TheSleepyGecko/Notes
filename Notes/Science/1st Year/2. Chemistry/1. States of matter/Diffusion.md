Diffusion is the movement of particles from a high concentration area to a low concentration area. An example of this is if you had people line up from one end of the room to the other and sprayed perfume, the people close to it will smell it first because that is the high concentration, while the people far away will take a long time to smell it because that is a lower concentration.
