## What is matter?
- Matter is anything that occupies space and has a mass.
- Matter is made up of extremely small particles called atoms and molecules.
- Atoms and molecules make up the three states of matter:
1. Solids
2. Liquids
3. Gases
4. Plasma
- The properties of a substance tells us how that substance will behave.

### Changing of state.

Some objects are able to change state. An example of this is when you get an ice cube which is  solid and then melts and turns into a liquid and then if you boil it evaporates and turns into a gas.

1. Melting is the changing of a solid into a liquid, during this process energy is gained.
2. Evaporating is the changing of a liquid into a gas, during this process energy is gained.
3. Condensing is the changing of a gas into a liquid, when this happens energy is lost.
4. Freezing is the changing of a liquid into a solid, during this process energy is lost.

### Sublimation
Some substances sublime. This means they go straight from a sold to a gas without forming a liquid.

**Solid** <--------> **Gas**

Substances that sublime include:
- Carbon dioxide (Dry Ice)
- Comets as they approach the sun.
