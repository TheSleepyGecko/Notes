Distillation is a method of separation that can be used on a soluble solid and its solvent, or on two miscible liquids (liquids that can mix). It is used when the two substances to be separated have different boilding points.

You heat up the liquids and they will travel upwards until they reach the Liebig condenser which turns them back into a liquid through condensation and then they are separated.
