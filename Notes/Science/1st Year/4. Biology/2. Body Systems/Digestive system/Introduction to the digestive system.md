| Part of digestive system | Function                                                                                                                                | Food group broken down | Type of digestion                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mouth                    | Takes in food, Breaks food down, chemically and mechanically.                                                                           | Carbohydrates          | Mechanical - teeth grind, tear, bite and chew. Chemical - enzyme salivary amylase is released. |
| Oesophagus               | A muscular tube that allows food to be passed to the stomach.                                                                           |                        |                                                                                                |
| Stomach                  | Churns food, contains hydrochloric acid (HCI), which kills bacteria and allows enzymes to work. Enzymes are present to break down food. | Proeins                | Mechainical - Churning. Chemical - Adding of enzyme pepsin.                                    | 

>[!Digestion]
>The breaking down of food.

>[!Enzyme]
>A protein that speeds up a chemical reaction in an organism.

> [!Catalyst]
> Speeds up a chemical reaction without being used itself in the reaction. An enzyme is a biological catalyst.

> [!Mechanical digestion]
> Physical breakdown of food.
> Tongue, teeth and stomach

> [!Chemical digestion]
> Digestive juices and enzymes are added to food to help break it down.
> The enzyme amylase breaks down starch into maltose.
> Found in saliva, small intestine and stomach.

> [!Absorption]
> The process in which the nutrients in the food are passed into the bloodstream at the small intestine.

### Bacteria

- Bacteria in our digestive system is called gut flora. Most live in the large intestine. They are harmless most of the time. We provide them with a place to live, and they allow us to function properly.
