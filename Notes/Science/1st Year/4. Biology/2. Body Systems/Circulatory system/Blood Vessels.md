Blood is carried about your body in 3 main types of blood vessels.

1. Arteries
2. Veins
3. Capillaries

### Arteries
- Arteries carry blood away from your heart to your organs. The blood they hold is usually bright-red, oxygenated blood.

### Veins
- Veins carry blood to your heart from your organs. Blood that is low in oxygen and therefore a deep purple-red colour. You have valves that prevent the backflow of blood.

### Capillaries
- Capillaries form a huge network linking arteries and veins. They are tiny blood vessels the walls are very thin, and have a small opening called a lumen.

### Double circulatory system in mammals
- One transport system carries blood from your heart to your lungs and back again. The other transport system carries blood from your heart to all other organs of your body and back again. It makes our circulatory system very efficient. More areas of your body will receive oxygenated blood quickly, as blood can be sent off to different parts of the body at a high pressure.
