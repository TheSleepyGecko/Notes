**Deoxygenated blood:**

- Enters into the heart through the vena cava and into the right atrium. The right atrium contracts, forcing blood down into the right ventricle. Chambers contract and blood is forced out of the heart to the lungs in the pulmonary artery.

**Oxygenated blood:**

- Blood returns to the heart from the lungs via the pulmonary vein. Blood is pumped down out of the left atrium to the left ventricle. Chambers contract and blood is pumped out to the body in the aorta.
