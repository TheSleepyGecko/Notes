Food + Oxygen â†’ Energy + Carbon Dioxide + Water Vapor.

### Breathing

- Animals take oxygen into the lungs. Animals release carbon dioxide from the lungs.

- Breathing rate is how many breaths you take per minute.

##### Why do we breathe more when we exercise?

We breathe more when we exercise because we need more energy, so we take in oxygen to account for that energy deficit.

**1. What is gas exchange?**
The process of oxygen and carbon dioxide moving between the lungs and the blood.

**2. What are the lungs?**
The lungs are the organs of respiration.

**3. What is respiration?**
Respiration is the process of breathing and converting food and oxygen into energy and carbon dioxide.

**Aerobic respiration requires oxygen and glucose?**
Aerobic respiration is the use of glucose in food to produce energy.

**5. What is Anaerobic respiration?**
Anaerobic respiration is what happens when you exercise without proper warming up or energy. This happens in microorganisms.

| Part                              | Function                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Nose                              | Cleans, warms and moistens air           |
| Trachea (Windpipe)                | Allows air to pass to and from the lungs |
| Bronchi                           | Allow air to pass to and from the lungs  |
| Bronchioles                       | Allow air to pass to and from the lungs  |
| Alveoli                           | Enable gas exchange                      | 
| Diaphragm and intercostal muscles | Cause air to move in or out of the lungs |

### Gas exchange

- The alveoli are adapted to make gas exchange in lungs happen easily and efficiently.
- Features of the alveoli that allow gas exchange.....

1. They have moist, thin walls (just one cell thick)
2. They give the lungs a massive surface area.
3. They have lots of tiny blood vessels, called capillaries.

- In the lungs. Oxygen passes from the alveoli into the blood. Carbon dioxide and water pass from the blood into the alveoli.

- Diffusion is the process by where gases move from a high concentration to a low concentration. Oxygen diffuses from the air in the alveoli into the blood. Carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the air in the alveoli.

#### The composition on inhaled and exhaled air.

| Substance      | % In inhaled air | % in exhaled air             |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Nitrogen       | 78               | 78                           |
| Oxygen         | 21               | 16                           |
| Carbon Dioxide | 0.04             | 4                            |
| Water Vapour   | Variable         | Much higher than inhaled air |

### Smoking

- Clogs tiny hairs in the nose.
- Causes irritation causing 'smoker's cough'
- Causes frequent lung infections.
- Increases the risk of lung cancer and heart disease.
- Heart attacks.
- Smoking whilepregnantt can affect development.
