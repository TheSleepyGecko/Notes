- Energy is the ability to do work. The unit of energy is the Joule. There are 9 main types of energy.

##### Heat/Thermal Energy

Anything with a temperature above absolute zero (-273C) has heat energy. Heat energy can cause movement.

##### Kinetic Energy

Anything that moves has kinetic energy.

##### Sound energy

Anything noisy gives off sound energy, like vocal cords, speakers, and instruments.

##### Light/Solar energy

Anything luminous gives off light energy, like the sun, light bulbs, and candles.

##### Chemical energy

Anything with stored energy which can be released by a chemical reaction has chemical energy, things like food, fuels, and batteries.

##### Electrical energy

Wherever there is a current flowing, there is electrical energy.

##### Potential energy

Anything that can change position or shape will have potential energy.

##### Nuclear energy

Released from only nuclear reactions.

##### Magnetic energy

Most electrical motors are examples of magnets causing movement. Large, powerful magnets can be used in scrapyards to move cars.
