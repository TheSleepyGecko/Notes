There is no definite answer to how the universe began, but there are still theory's about how the universe started. One of the most popular theorys to how the universe started, is the big bang theory.

This theory says that there was a rapid and sudden expansion of the universe. A split second before the big bang there was a black hole. At the sigularity of the black hole there was all of the matter contained in the universe and then it collasped allowing the universe to begin exsisting.

Two more theorys related to the start of the universe are...

**The big bounce:** This means that the universe will stop expanding and bounce back to a sigularity.
**The heat death of the universe:** This is a theory which says that all energy in the universe will reach equlibrium and be stored inside black holes.
