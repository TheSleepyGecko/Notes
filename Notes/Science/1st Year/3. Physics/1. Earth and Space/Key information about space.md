The Universe describes everything that exsists. Space is the empty region between matter in the Universe. **Celestial** means anything related to or in space. A common term when talking about space is <mark class="hltr-green">Celestial Body is a natural object whuch is located outside of Earth's atmosphere such as the Moon, Stars or planets.</mark>

Galaxies are collection of millions or billions of stars they are either elliptical(Oval shaped) or spiral(spinning in a circle)

A Solar system is what a star and the planets orbiting it are called. Our solar system is made up of the Sun and the eight planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Our solar system is located in the Milky way galaxy. The sun is a very large object and as a result has a very large gravitantional pull. Gravitational pull allows the planets to move in an eliptical orbit around the sun.

What is a star? A star is a luminous object made up of gas that can produce its own light and heat via nuclear reaction. Luminosity is based off of decreasing surface temperature and it indicates what material the star is made up of. Our star, the sun was formed around 4.5 billion years ago, when the solar system formed. The sun is classified as a main sequence star. This is the longest most stable period of a stars life. The method in that stars keep produncing heat is by converting hydrogen to helium in its core generating heat and light, this is a result of the extreme heat and pressure.

To be considered a planet there are three conditions that must be met. The planet must orbit a star. It must have enough mass so that its gravity forms it into a sphere. And finally the object must be big enough to move other objects a similar size to it out of the way when it is orbiting the sun. Another type of plant is an **Exoplanet** these are planets that orbit a different star than our sun. There are two types of planets, terrestial which are rocky planets and Jovian which are gas/ice planets.

Moons are objects that are found revolving around the planets in our solar system. Moons come in many shapes, sizes and types. An example of this is titain a moon of jupiter and has lakes forests and caves! They are generally solid bodies, and a few of them have atmospheres.

| Planet  | Number of moons |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Mercury | 0               |
| Venus   | 0               |
| Earth   | 1               |
| Mars    | 2               |
| Jupiter | 63              |
| Saturn  | 60              |
| Uranus  | 27              |
| Neptune | 13                |

Earth's moon is the fifth largest moon in the solar system. It is Tidally locked which means it will complete exactly 1 rotation during its orbit. The moon was formed when a mars sized body collided with Earth.

Comets are made from a mixture of frozen gases, icem dust and small rocks. Comets are unable to support life. Their "tails" will not always go away from where they are heading, they will head away from a star if there is one nearby. It is possible that they brought water and other compounds to Earth.

Asteroids are giant rocks that orbit the sun that are too small to be called planets. There are millions of them in our solar system. About  three quarters are in the asteroid belt, a ring between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Scientists have discovered that a giant asteroid struck Earth 65 million years ago. It was probably responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs.
