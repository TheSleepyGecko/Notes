- A monk's main activity of the day was prayer which would happen up to 8 times every day! During the day other than praying they also farmed.
- Cooks prepared the food for the monks to eat.
- Some monks produced manuscripts that told religious stories for example the Book of Kells. These Manuscripts were made by scribes, who worked in the scriptorium.
- The scribes wrote on something called vellum (calf skin) or on a parchment made of sheepskin.
- For pens they used quills (goose or swan feathers). These pens were dipped in inks made from plants and powdered rocks.
- Many of these manuscripts were beautifully decorated.
