- Round towers were very tall stone towers which were wider at the bottom and narrower at the top. The towers were used as belfries, storage and safety when under attack from Vikings.
- The door was high up of the ground so attackers could not enter and was accessed with a ladder. At the top there were four windows, North, South, East and West.
