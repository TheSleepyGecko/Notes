A monastery was a collection building where monks would pray or write down ancient scripts or even help other people by letting them stay there or feeding them.

Priests or Men like St. Edna set up monasteries at places like the Aran Islands or Skellig Michael. Most of these monasteries are very remote and off the coast of Ireland.

The largest monasteries were located at Clonard, Kells, Clonmacnoise, Glendalough and Clonfert.
