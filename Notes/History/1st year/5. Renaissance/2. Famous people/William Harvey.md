- William Harvey was born in England in 1578. He studied medicine at Padua University between 1598 and 1602. He was very interested in anatomy, particularly the work of Vesalius. After leaving university, he worked as a doctor at St. Bartholomew's hospital, London, and then as a lecturer in anatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons. He was also a physician to both James I and Charles I.

- Harvey believed in the importance of careful observation, dissection, and experiments in order to improve his knowledge of how the body worked. In 1615 Harvey began to work on the idea that blood circulated around the body. Around this time, water pumps were invented. This gave Harvey the idea that perhaps the heart worked in the same way as a water pump and pumped blood around the body.

- Harvey wanted to study the body as a living system, so he needed to dissect things which were still alive. He chose to study cold-blooded animals like frogs because their hearts beat slowly. This enabled him to see each separate expansion and contraction of the heart. He also dissected the bodies of dead criminals to unsure that the human heart was the same as that of the live animals he had studied.

- Harvey's study of beating hearts showed him that the heart was pushing out large volumes of blood. He proved that each push happened at the same time as the pulse, which could be felt at the neck and wrist. He realized that so much blood was being pumped out by the heart, that it could not be used up and replaced by new blood, as Galen had said. This suggested that there was a fixed amount of blood in the body, and that it was circulating. Live animals had been studied.

- Harvey now needed to prove his theory, By trying to pump liquids the wrong way past the valves in veins and arteries, Harvey proved that they were all a one-way system. This proved his theory that blood flowed out from the heart through the arteries, and it flowed back through the veins to the heart where it was used again. He also devised a simple experiment that anyone could use on themselves to prove that blood only flows one way through the veins.

- By bandaging the upper arm, the valves show up as nodules on the vein. If your finger is pushed along the vein from one valve to the next, away from the heart, the section of vein will be emptied of blood. It will stay empty until you take your finger off. Harvey published his theory of circulation of blood in his book, On the Motion of the Heart, in 1628, He included a sketch of how to perform this single experiment, to prove his theory to readers.

- After Harvey published his theory, but blood-letting(cutting patient's wrists to let out the “bad blood”) was still very popular until the 1900s.
