William Shakespeare was born in England in 1564. When he was 18 he married an older woman called Anne Hathaway. He joined the Lord Chamberlain's Men acting company, where he acted and wrote plays. He is said to be one of the greatest playwright in the English language.

His plays were performed in the Globe Theatre in London. It is open air, so they were performed in daylight. Shakespeare also had it open to all classes, not just the higher class.

The Renaissance helped Shakespeare spread his plays and writings. The invention of the printing press meant Shakespeare could send his plays and writings across England. It helped him become more famous and well known.
