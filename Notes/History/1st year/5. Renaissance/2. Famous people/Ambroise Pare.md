- Ambroise Pare was born in France in 1510. He began training as a barber surgeon in 1533. He became a military surgeon for the French army in 1537. By the time of his death, aged 90, he had been surgeon to four French kings and was the most famous surgeon of his age.

- France was often at war during the 1500s. Pare had plenty of time to practice his craft as a military surgeon. Three main problems faced surgeons at this time.
1. Pain.
2. Infection.
3. Bleeding.

- These caused patients to die. The musket was becoming the most widely used weapon, but the method of treating the wounds—cauterization(burning people with hot metal) – caused a lot of pain. Pare wanted to find a way to overcome this concern.

- The ways of treating gunshot wounds before Pare.

1) If the wound was not too serious, it was filled with boiling oil to stop the bleeding.
2) If the patient needed an amputation, the area would be burnt with a red-hot iron, called a cautery iron, to stop the bleeding.

- Pare developed two new methods for treating gunshot wounds.

1) (For less serious wounds) Pare made an accidental discovery made when he ran out of oil that he had been using to pour into gunshot wounds. He used a digestive (ointment) instead, made from egg yolks, rose oil, and turpentine. He discovered that this **reduced pain** greatly. Cauterization was not necessary, and the ointment soothed the area around the wound. It also fought **infection**, making the wound heal quicker.

2) (For amputation) Pare made sure the patient was strong by feeding them meat and eggs. He tied the area above the part to be amputated, using a ligature. This held the skin covering the muscles and bones and cut off the blood supply to the area that would be amputated. Once the limb was amputated. Pare would use a crow's beak (an instrument that resembles a par of pliers) to pull out arteries and veins before, tying them off and sewing them up as quickly as possible using silk thread. This meant **less bleeding** and therefore less chance of death from loss of blood.

- In 1575 Pare published, The Collected Works of Surgery. This work was initially attacked by the French Faculty of Physicians, but thanks to the support of Henry II, the King at the time. The book began to spread Pare's ideas across Europe.

- Over time, these ideas began to change the way that surgeons approached their work – especially when treating wounds and performing amputations. Surgeons now knew that for operations to be successful they would have to combat pain, infection, and bleeding using methods similar to those used by Pare.
