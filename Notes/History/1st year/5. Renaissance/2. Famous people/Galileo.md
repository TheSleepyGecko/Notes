- Galileo Galilei was born in 1564 near Pisa in Italy. He studied medicine in the University of Pisa in 1581. He disliked medicine, so he changed to Math and Philosophy. Furthermore, he was appointed as chair of the Math Department at the University of Padua in 1592 at the age of 24.

- While in Pisa, he proved that objects fall to earth at the same speed regardless of weight using a math formula. He called this the theory of the speed of falling bodies. Before he discovered this, people thought that heavier objects fell faster than lighter ones.

- A Dutch inventor, Jan Lippershey, invented the telescope in 1608 and Galileo made improvements to this. Galileo's telescope could magnify things x32 times. Using his telescope, he could show that the moon had mountains and craters, that Jupiter had four moons and he witnessed sunspots. Galileo supported the theory that the Earth revolved around the sun and not the other way round. This theory was invented by a man named Copernicus and was the opposite of what the Catholic Church said. He wrote a book in 1632 about this theory, which was called “Two Chief World Systems”.

- Galileo was summoned in front of the Church's Inquisition to explain his theory. His trial lasted several months, and Galileo was facing being burnt at the stake. He agreed to retract his views and returned to Florence, where he lived under house arrest and could not have any guests. He became blind in 1637 and died in 1642.
