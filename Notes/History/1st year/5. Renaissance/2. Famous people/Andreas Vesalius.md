- Vesalius wrote what is considered to be one of the most important books in the history of medicine, The fabric of the human body (1543). It showed for the first time how nerves are connected to muscles, how bones are nourished, and the complex structure of the brain.
- It was a complete map of the human body, complete with life like illustrations. The Church now allowed human dissection, but did not allow bodies to be boiled up to produce skeletons. Vesalius desperately wanted to examine the human skeleton.

- The only way he could do this was to wait until the bodies of hung criminals had decomposed on the gallows. When the bones were bare, he would remove the bodies and smuggle them back into town to study them.

- Vesalius was so successful that he became Professor of Surgery (responsible for teaching anatomy) at Padua University when he was just 23. If dissections took place, they were usually carried out by Barber Surgeons who had no medical qualifications.

- In contrast, Vesalius gave lectures in which he carried out dissections in front of his students, explaining his own theories.

- Hundreds came to watch each lecture. He also encouraged his students to examine the human body for themselves.
