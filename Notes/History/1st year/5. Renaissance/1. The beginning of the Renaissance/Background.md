### Why in Italy?

- The ruins of Ancient Rome throughout Italy inspired the  Renaissance artists, sculptures ect...
-  Italy was made up of City states. (Florence, Milan, Genoa and Venice) who all competed against each other which helped to push people further and further.
- Italian cities were wealthy from trade and many of the rich became patrons of the arts (Medici Family in Florence)
- Constaninople (Istanbul) fell to the Turks and many scholars fled to Italy with previously lost books and texts. The printing press was invented during the middle of the 15th century which allowed ideas to spread quickly.
