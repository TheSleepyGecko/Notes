- There were three stages to becoming an artist:

1. At about 12, they became an apprentice in a master's workshop where they learned drawing techniques, how to make paint and how to paint frescos.
2. When trained, they became a member of a guild which allowed them to work as a Journeyman artist. They depended on Patrons to fund their work.
3. They could then become a master and train their own apprentices.
