**Medieval art:** Lifeless, Little variety in colour, faces are similar, no depth

**Renaissance art:** Realistic, Emotions, Depth.

- Renaissance painters painted:

	1. People as they were in real life.
	2. Using perspective to show distance and size in a picture.
	3. Using a method known as Sfumato which was a way of painting light and shade.
	4. Portraits of people
	5. frescos which were paintings on walls.

- The use of perspective creates an illusion. It makes you think that there is depth in the painting. It makes it look like itâ€™s 3 dimensions, height, width, depth.

- A fresco was a painting done on wet, damp plaster (in cathedrals)
