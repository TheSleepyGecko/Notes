### Catholic Church Abuses

1. Nepotism - `Giving important positions in the Church to relatives wether they were sutiable or not`
2. Simony - `Paying bribes to become a biship or abbot`
3. Pluralism - `Holding several church positions at the same time`
4. Absenteeism - `Living away from the place they were appointed to serve`
5. Indulgences - `People paying money to the church to but salvation from their sins`

- By 1500 the Church had collected an enormous amount of wealth. In Germany, the Catholic Church owned about one-third of the land. People became jealous of this wealth. Many princes and kings wanted to use this wealth to build up their countries.

- The Renaissance encouraged people to question everything. This applied to all areas of knowledge, including religion. Many people began to criticize the Church and say that it was not following the teaching of the Bible.
