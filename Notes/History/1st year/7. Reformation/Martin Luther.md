- Martin Luther was born in Germany in 1483. He originally studied to become a lawyer at the University of Erfurt but then decided to become a priest and joined the Augustinian order.
- He became a professor of Theology (Study of God) at Wittenberg University.

##### Salvation

- Luther was worried that sinners would not go to heaven. He read through the Bible and found that 'the just man shall live by faith alone'.
- He called this 'justification by faith alone'. Basically, it meant that you could only get to Heaven by believing in God and following his teachings.

##### Sale of Indulgences

- In 1517 a Dominican friar, John Tezel, came to Wittenberg to preach and sell indulgences. He said that anyone could buy an indulgence and get into Heaven.
- The money Tezel was collecting was to be spent on building St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and to the Archbishop of Mainz to pay back money he had borrowed to buy bishoprics.

##### Luther's 95 Theses
- Luther objected to Tetzel's preaching. He wrote up 95 Theses and nailed them to the church door of Wittenberg castle. They were written in Latin, and Luther wanted to discuss these views with other scholars, not start a rebellion.
- Luther's work was translated into German and printed and distributed all across Germany. Luther found that many Germans objected to paying money to Rome and thought that many of their priests were ignorant.

### Rome's Response

- The pope took several actions against Luther. Luther was ordered to meet Cardinal Cajetan who tried and failed to change Luther's views.
- The Pope arranged a debate between Luther and John Eck and in the debate Luther questioned the authority of the Pope. In 1520 the Pope sent a Papal Bull to Luther.
- The Papal Bull was a special letter that stated that if Luther didn't stop, his teachings would be excommunicated, and he would not receive sacraments. Luther burned the letter in public.

### The diet of Worms

- The Pope asked the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, to deal with Luther. Charles called a Diet (Parliament) of German princes to meet at Worms in 1521. The Emperor asked Luther to attend and promised him safe passage.

- Luther spoke at the Diet of Worms and refused to withdraw his teachings. The Emporer then issued the Edict of Worms, and order to take Luther prisoner.

- Lutherians built churches and took over Catholic ones. Luther died in 1546 before war broke out between Protestants and Catholics.

### Peace of Augsburg

- The peace of Augsburg (1555) ended the war by stating that each ruler was free to decide the religion of their state, and remove people who were not of that religion.

### Why did Lutheranism spread?

- The influence of the printing press.
- The support of German princes.
- The German princes wanting to control the wealth of the Catholic Church.
- Germans did not want to pay money to Rome.

### Results

- Germany was divided along religious lines. The Bible was translated in German and Lutherans held their ceremonies in German, resulting in an increase in the use of vernacular language. Literacy and education spread because people could read the Bible in their own language. Today, Lutheranism is still strong in Northern Europe and the United States.
