**Maps –** The earliest maps were called portolan charts. They showed places along the coasts. The straight lines gave the course or direction which sailors followed. New and better maps would be needed for further exploration.

Compasses were used to tell sailors which direction they were sailing in.

**Longitude and Latitude** – Latitude means the degree north or south of the equator. Sailors used astrolabes to find the ship's position north or south of the equator. Quadrants and cross staffs to find latitude. Longitude refers to the degrees east or west, but couldn't be worked out accurately until the 18th century.

Speed was measured using a log and line and a sand glass. The line(rope) was marked with knots in equal distance, tied to a log and thrown overboard. The speed of the ship was calculated by measuring the number of knots that passed through a sailor's hand before all the sand fell to the bottom of the sand glass (hourglass). This is where we get the term 'knots' to measure a ship's speed.

Sailors measured the depth of the water using a line with a lead weight, and sailors would call out the depth. The logbook recorded details of each voyage (Direction, Distance, winds, etc.) which could be used again on later voyages.
