- There had been trade routes between China and Europe for years. Silk, Spices, and Jewels were brought from Asia and the Spice Islands. Spices were really important as they preserved and added taste to food or could cure some diseases.

- These routes were used by Arabs and Italy and countries like Portugal and Spain which wanted new routes of their own. They also wanted to find quicker routes to these places. Leaders of these voyages hoped for great wealth and fame. Governments of European countries funded the voyages and hoped for new lands to add to their empires.

- Europeans wanted to defeat and conquer Muslims who controlled most trade routes. They also wanted to spread Christianity. During the renaissance people questioned old ideas and they wanted to explore new ideas and places.
