> The disease which killed the Incas and the Aztecs is called smallpox

- The Inkas had the largest population in the world, with nearly 10 million subjects. It covered over 900,000sq kilometers. The Inkas began their empire around 1200CE. 

- The Incas lived high up in the Andes in Peru. They had cities with fine buildings, roads and gold ornaments along with a well organized system of government. Pizarro heard of the gold there and decided to conquer the Incas. He arrived with 180 men and 37 horses and demanded a room full of gold as ransom for the Inca king, Atahualpa, who they had captured.

- The Spanish received the gold, but killed Atahualpa anyway. The Spanish then defeated the Incas, who could not cope with the Spanish weapons and horses. They enslaved the Incas and gave the land to Spanish settlers. Overwork, disease and cruel treatment killed many Incas.
