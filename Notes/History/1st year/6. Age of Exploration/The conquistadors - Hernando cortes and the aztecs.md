Hernando Cortes was born in Spain in 1485. He was a soldier and an adventurer who had heard that there was a lot of gold in Mexico. He was pt in charge of an expedition of eleven ships and 600 men to Mexico in 1519. Furthermore, he landed in Vera Cruz in 1519 and destroyed all of his ships so that his men would not even attempt to commit mutiny.

Mexico belonged to the Aztecs and their king, Montezuma, who lived in Tenochtitlan, which was a large city built on islands inside a huge lake. They could write, loved music and dance, but could not make iron or wheels. Their cities had temples like pyramids where prisoners were sacrificed to gods by having their hearts cut out and bodies thrown from the tops of the temples.

The Conquistadors were helped by other native tribes that the Aztecs had conquered. The natives were unhappy with slavery, heavy taxes and human sacrifices. The Aztecs believed that one day their God, Quetzalcoatl, would return to them, and they believed this was Cortes. The natives thought that the conquistadors on horses were gods with six legs and two heads.

As Cortes entered the capital, Tenochtitlan, the Aztec leader, Montezuma, greeted him. The Spanish then started looting gold from the city. The Aztec people thought that Montezuma had betrayed them, so they killed him. Cortes and the Spaniards escaped but returned with the aid of local tribes and an army of 100,000 to capture the city.

The Spanish had the advantage of using guns and horses, which the Aztecs did not have. They captured and destroyed the city and enslaved its people and made them work in the gold and silver mines. Cortes rebuilt the city and colonized it with their religion, cattle and farming methods and called it 'Mexico City'.
