### Native population

Native populations in the new world suffered greatly at the hands of the Europeans. The natives lost their land and became slaves. Disease was the worst and was carried by European who had built up immunity. Native populations had no immunity to these diseases, and millions of them died â€“ the native population of Mexico fell from 30 million in 1519 to 3 million in 1568 due to smallpox.

### Slavery
Over 10 million Africans were forcefully taken from Africa to the New World. The slave trade lasted over 300 years.
