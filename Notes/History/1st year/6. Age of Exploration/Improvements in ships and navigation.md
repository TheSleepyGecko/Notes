**Caravels â€“** The Portuguese invented new ships called caravels. They were small, fast, and easy to steer. The combined the best parts of all previous ships.

Caravels were clinker-built, meaning the boards on the side of the ship overlapped. Caravels used both square and lateen (triangular) sails.

Square sails were used to sail faster, and lateen sails were used to sail against the wind and explore bays.

Caravels were steered by a rudder (small paddle at the back of the boat) this gave more control over the ship's steering.

They had castles (raised areas) on decks at the front and at the back of the boat. They used these to spot enemy ships and prepare for an attack. Sometimes larger ships called 'carracks' or 'naos' were used.
