- Knights started being put into battle and being trained in the 8th century. 
- Knights were specially trained fighters. They would fight on horseback with short and long ranged weapons such as maces and battle aces. 
- As reward for risking their lives they got Benefices which were plots of land.
- They were praised for their job and they also drove Muslims out of their kingdom.
- They went through 3 stages of training. Stage 1: At 7, they became a page. They went to live with other lords and learn about good manners, horse riding and how to help the lady of the castle.
- Stage 2: At 14, they became squires. They helped the lords dress for battles and practice with swords and shields and to upkeep armour.
- Stage 3: At 21, they were knighted by their lord. When they became a knight they took an oath called the chivalry which meant  `He promised To be truthful, generous and loyal. To be nice to the poor. To protect women and children.`
- The armour that these knights wore was either early chainmail armour or the more advanced plate armour which protected them very well, but it had limited mobility.
- To keep on top of their skills they would participate in tournaments such as jousting.
- Knights disappeared around the 15th century because of the invention of gunpowder weapons.
