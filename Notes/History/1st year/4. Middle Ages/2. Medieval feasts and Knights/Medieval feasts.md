- Feasts were hosted by the lord and lady in their great hall.  They were sat at a table that was higher than the others so that they could look down on them.
- They ate the finest meats and fish on a Friday as eating meat was banned by the church on Fridays.  They used Knives to cut the meat but they ate with their fingers.
- Music and jesters were the entertainment while they ate.
