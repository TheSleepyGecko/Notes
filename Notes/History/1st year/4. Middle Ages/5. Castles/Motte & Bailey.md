Castles were built to defend the land, provide a place to live and to provide shelter from forign attackers. The Motte is where the castle would be built. It was a large sometimes man made hill with the castle on the top. This gave a good view of the surrounding area.

Inside the Baily there were; Home, Stables, Barracks, Blacksmiths and other workshops. The Bailey was located at the bottom of the hill. The  Bailey was surrounded by a large ditch called a Moat. The Moat would be filled with water to stop attackers climbing into the Bailey.
