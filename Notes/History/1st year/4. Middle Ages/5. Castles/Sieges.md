One method of attacking a castle was to lay siege to it. This meant to surround the castle. They used machines to fire rocks, fireballs and large arrows towards the castle. The used scaling ladders(Large ladders to enter the Castle) and siege towers(Wooden towers used to fire arrows over the curtain walls and to get closer without getting injured) to climb the curtain walls(The outside walls)

They could also use battering rams to break down the gatehouse(Room beside the Portcullis) The most successful way to attack was to undermine the wall which meant tunneling under the walls causing it to colapse.
