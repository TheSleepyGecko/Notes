- At the time, no one knew where the disease came from.. So people believed it was a punishment from God for their sins. They believed if they prayed and fasted they would escape the disease. Others blamed people like jews and this caused many killings.

- Nearly 30% - 60% of the population of Europe died from the black death. There was a shortage of workers as many people died. Rents reduced to attract tenants. Much of the land went to waste. Some places had uprisings. Theree was an english uprising in 1381. Many people blamed jews for the disease so they were kicked out.
