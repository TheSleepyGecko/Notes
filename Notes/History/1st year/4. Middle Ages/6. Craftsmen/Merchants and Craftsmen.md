- The two main types of jobs in medieval town were the Merchants and the Craftsmen.

- Merchants sold and traded goods such as wool, iron, wood and exotic spices and silks. Craftsmen included ironmongers, bakers, carpenters and butchers. When they made their goods they would sell them to different people.
