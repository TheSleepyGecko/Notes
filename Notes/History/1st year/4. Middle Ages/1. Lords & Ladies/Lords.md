The lord of the castle was a powerful man in ancient times. The lord was given land by the king, using it to build castles and rule their area. His job was to organise the running of the castle, to keep things under control and to follow orders from the king.

Some of the orders that would be given to the lord might include 
- fighting for the king and helping him rule the country.
- Hold court and settle dispute in his own land.
- He would hunt for fresh fish and meat along with the other soldiers.
- He would also appear in the King's court when ever he wished.
