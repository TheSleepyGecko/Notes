The deeper down the in the soil it's found, the older it is, this is called stratigraphy. Carbon dating is measuring the amount of carbon within a plant, animal or body. The older an object is, the less carbon it will have.

Dendrochronology is comparing the pattern of rings in old pieces of timber. The more rings the wood has, the older it is. When the artifact is dated, it may be sent to a museum to be put on display.
