### Historian

History is the study of past events. A historian's job is to learn about and discover parts of history. Historians use primary and secondary sources to learn about the past. A primary source is a source which comes from the time being studied, examples of this include autobiographies, diaries, or interviews. A secondary source is a source which comes after the time being studied, examples of this include biographies, textbooks, or reviews. 

Autobiographies are books written about someone's life, written by that person. Biographies are books written about someone's life, written by someone else. A museum is a collection of physical artifacts. An archive is a collection of written sources which have been digitalized.

Bias is preferring one side over the other. Prejudice is judging someone before you know them. Propaganda is a mix of truth and lies spread by the media.

### Archeologist

Archeology is the study of the past through physical artifacts or material remains. Artifacts are small pieces of material evidence such as necklaces, coins, pots, or jewelry. Prehistory is the time before writing was invented.

When you are investigating an archeological site, the first thing you must do is to choose a location. Locations can be decided by myths, legends, or drones to get an overview of a potential area. This can help because you can see structures that would not be visible from the ground.

Once archeologists have decided on a dig site, they will create a grid of squares. This is so that they can dig near found artifacts for a higher chance on finding more. Once an artifact has been found it is put into an airtight bag, numbered and photographed so that it can be examined in a labratory.
