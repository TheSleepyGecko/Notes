On an excavation site, they would use small brushes to brush and clean small objects. Sieves to shift through dirt and find small coins or jewelry. Diggers to remove a large amount of topsoil (the top layer of soil). Finally, trowels to dig carefully around houses.

After deciding on a site archaeologists, survey the site and draw an accurate plan. A geophysical survey is like an underground X-Ray. Diggers are then used to remove the topsoil. A grid of squares is mapped out to record all findings. A hand pick is used to loosen the soil.

- All records must be kept accurately:

1. All artifacts are numbered
2. They are then put into separate airtight bags
3. They are cataloged in a site book or field computer
4. Photographs are taken throughout the whole dig to record every stage of the excavation
5. The finds are then sent to the laboratory
