Archeology is the study of ancient human past through material remains. They dig things up from the ground. Evidence for the early history of people comes from material remains. These remains up of artifacts and buildings.

An artifact is an object such as spears, pots, coins, and jewelry. Prehistory is the time before writing was used.

Some sites might be above ground and easily visible. Other sites are below ground and are more difficult to find. Aerial photography show indications of ancient walls, roads, or buildings. Sonar, miniature submarines and diving equipment can help archaeologists find artifacts under the sea.

Sometimes people can stumble across ancient artifacts or entire archeological sites, these are called chance discoveries. Some myths and legends from history are based on actual events.

Archeologists usually decide to excavate near old buildings, in the center of cities when old houses are being replaced this is called rescue archeology, where aerial photos show old fields or houses. Also, where legends are said to be set.
