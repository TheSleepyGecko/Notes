History is the study of the past. Historians use sources to tell us about the past. A primary source comes directly from the time that is being studied. A secondary source comes from after the time being studied.

Written sources are sources that are usually written in Latin and then translated later. Manuscripts are books written by hand. An autobiography is the story of a person's life, written by them themselves. A biography is the story of a person's life written by someone else.

Oral sources are sources that have records of people speaking, and visual sources are structures, pictures, or artifacts.

Museums store objects and artifacts. Libraries store written sources such as books. Archives store digital records of historical records.

The use of time and dates is called a 'chronology'

A.D - Anno Domini and is after B.C

When historians are using sources, they must be careful to avoid bias. Bias is when somebody favors one side over another. Prejudice is when you make up your mind before you know what happened. Propaganda is the use of media to appeal to people's feelings, it is usually a mix of truth, half-truth, and lies (remember it is not always politicians and can be anything that is media a rumor for example.)
