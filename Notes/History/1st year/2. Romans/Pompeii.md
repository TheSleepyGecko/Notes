Pompeii & Herculaneum were two roman cities in the bay of Naples in Italy. They were both wealthy towns due to trading 79AD both cities were buried under volcanic ash & lava. Over time these cities were forgotten but some letters survived to describe life there.

August 79AD Mount Vesuvius suddenly erupted after being dormant for 800 years. Tonnes of ash spurted up into the sky. Most people survived the first day but on the second Vesuvius erupted again with red-hot rock, gas & ash poured from the volcano.

This ash cloud travelled at 100kph, faster than people could run. Thousands of people died due to suffocation or from being hit by debris.

Their bodies would remain exactly as they died for the next 1,500 years with meals left uneaten on tables.

### Discovering Pompeii and Herculaneum
Both towns were found by accident. Pompeii were discovered when a water channel was being dug. Herculaneum when a well shaft was being built.

Excavations began in the 18th century. Giuseppe Fiorella is the man associated with the excavations of Pompeii. Finds were not recorded so many mosaics, statues, coins & vases were taken into private collections. Archaeologists began to study the site to find out about Roman life.
