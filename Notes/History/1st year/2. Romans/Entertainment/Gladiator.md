Gladiators would have fought in the colleseum. They would have armour and shields, and somtimes even a horse that they could ride on. Gladiators would also often be slaves or criminals and would resort to being a gladiator because the job would pay very well.

Some days in the colleseum animals might have been released, to make the fight more intresting if it was getting boring. 

At the end of a fight if one of the gladiators were at a huge disadvantage or about to be killed, the emporer would give them a thumbs up or down to say if that they should be killed.
