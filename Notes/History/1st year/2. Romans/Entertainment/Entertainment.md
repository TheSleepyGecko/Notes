People in ancient Rome had many ways to entertain themselves. May that be Gladiator fights in the Colleseum or Chariot racing in the circus maximus or even Plays! Or oddly enough somtimes Baths as a scocial activity. 

People had very diffrent sporting tastes then we do today. all of their sports back then were alot more violent then the ones we have today and many of them continued until someone had been killed in the colleseum and very little rules while chariot racing.
