Romans used the baths as a scocial activity. They were very diffrent from our baths today, one of these diffreneces is that they would use oil instead of soap to wash themselves and they used a tool called a strigil to scrape dirt off themselves.

Roman strigil!

There were three bath rooms the tepidarium which was a warm room, the caldarium which was a hot room and a frigidarium which was a cold room!

The way that these baths were heated was a system called hypocaust system and is still used today in football pitches or in people's houses. The way this system works is that underneath you have a fire and small pillars holding up the floor. As the air heated up it would make the walls and floors very hot.
