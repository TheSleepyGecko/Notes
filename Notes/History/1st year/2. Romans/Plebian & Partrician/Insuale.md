Some of the dangers with living in a Insuale would be that they could easily colapse and catch fire because they were construcuted of cheap materials meaning they were not very supported. Another risk is that there was no plumbing in the building.

Insuale were small, crowded and badly built upper stories were made from wood, Rooms were bare and conditions were very poor. There were no toilets or water supply so people had to use public toilets and fountains.
