Plebian food would not be very nourishing making it diffiicult to survive. Poorer families depended on bread for breakfast and lunch.

Plebians couldn't cook in the insuale so meals were usually cold or bought from inns and shops. Poverty was so pronounced in Rome the emporers gave a free suply of grain to 200,000 people every month to keep them happy, this was called the dole.
