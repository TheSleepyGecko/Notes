#### Main features of a Roman domus.

**Peristyle:** A walled garden normally  in the middle of the house.
**Culina:** Is a kitchen and that is how we got the word culinary.
**Atrium:** The entrance of a domus which had a pool of water in the middle to cool down the house.
**Cubicula:** A small bedroom which surrounds the peristyle.
**Lararium:** A small altar to pray to their gods.
**Triclinium:** A dining room with three tables and three couches.
**Taberna:** Small shops outside the front of the domus.
**Vomitorium:** An exit to the coliseum, not a room to get sick!

#### Domus decoration
The Domus was decorated with beautiful mosaics on the floors. These tiles were made up of tiny tiles of marble arranged into patterns or images. The walls were painted bright colours, the paint was applied directly onto damp plaster, these are known as frescoes
