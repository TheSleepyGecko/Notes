Spartacus was a slave who was kept in a Roman Luda which was a Roman galdiator school. Spartacus was treated cruely and led a massive rebelion against the Roman Empire.

He was a gladiator kept just outside of Naples and by the year 73BC spartacus led an army of 90,000 slaves.

He defeated many Roman slaves that tried to oppose him and his huge army of slaves and warriors.

Eventually the Roman senate sent Marcus Licinius against him. Crassus deafeated Spartacus' army.

Spartacus & 6,000 othere rebels were captured and crucified along the Appian way, a horrendous sight.
