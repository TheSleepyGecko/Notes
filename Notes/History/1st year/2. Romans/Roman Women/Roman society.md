Men were in control of the ancient Roman world and a "Woman's place" was in the home.

A woman was under control of her husband the paterfamilias which meant head of the family and could have been anyone in the family.

Women were encouraged to be obedient, hard working and to have many children, as a result of this many women died in childbirth and then the child would often die at a young age.

Male names were long and had a purpose while female names were always domitia which made it hard to reconstruct family trees.
