### Caol
If a word ends in igh or the last vowel is an E or I then it is a  caol verb, the first step is to remove the igh from the end of the word and replace it with somthing from this list.

### Squishables
If a word ends with -ir, -is, -il, -in, -ail then you have to squish the word by removing the vowels and keeping the constonant. Once you have completed this step you must identify if it is a Caol or Leathan word by checking the last vowel in the new word and then add the apptopiate ending.
