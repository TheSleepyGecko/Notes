# Parables

Jesus would always tell his followers about parables.
``Parables`` a story with a meaning.

### The Prodigal Son
A son asked his father can he have his inheritance, and then he went to a bar to get drunk with all his new money, but after all of his money was thorn out all of his friends left him and kicked him out, and he then had to eat scraps from a farm, because the country was experiencing a famine.

He then had to go home, he went to ask his father if he could be his slave and said I am not worthy to be your son. His father then decided to give him the best room, new shoes, a big meal as well clothes for him to wear.

The meaning behind this parable is **Forgiveness**
Even though he said to his father he was as good as dead, his father forgived him.

**Monotheistic** means that the religion only has one **God.**
**Polytheistic** means that that religion has multiple **gods.**
