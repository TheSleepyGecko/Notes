- To religious people of all faiths, the idea of communicating with God/gods is important
- They want to continue their relationship with God
- This communication is called prayer

- During world war 2 a Polish preist was keeping and protecting Jews.
- They sent him to Auschwitz, Maximilian beleived that it was the will of God that he was there.
- He gave his possesssions and food to prisoners he thought needed them more.
- After a while, prisoners started to come to him from all over the camp.

- One day 1 of the prisoners escaped so the gaurds chose 10 random people to be starved to death.
- Maximilian offered himself to be starved to death in place of one of the prisoners becaue he had a wife and kids.

- While starving to death, he said prayers and sang hymns with the other prisoners.
- This angered the gaurds, because prisoners still had hope.
- After two weeks of being starved all the other prisoners had died, Maximilian was the last survivor.
- He was killed by being injected with posion, even before his death he could be heard praying.
- After his death he was made a saint by the Catholic Chruch.
