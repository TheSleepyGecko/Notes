### Lyrics

When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be  
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree  
There will be an answer, let it be  
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see  
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be, be

And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me  
Shinin' until tomorrow, let it be  
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

And let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Another one of these famous songs with religous meanings behind it is "You've got the Love - Florence and the Machine" these are the lyrics...

### Lyrics

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air  
I know I can count on you  
Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord I just don't care"  
But you've got the love I need to see me through

Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough  
And things go wrong no matter what I do  
Now and then it seems that life is just too much  
But you've got the love I need to see me through

When food is gone you are my daily meal  
When friends are gone I know my saviour's love is real  
You know it's real

'Cause you've got the love  
You've got the love  
You've got the love  
You've got the love  
You've got the love  
You've got the love

Time after time I think "Oh, Lord, what's the use?"  
Time after time I think it's just no good  
'Cause sooner or later in life, the things you love you lose  
But you've got the love I need to see me through

You've got the love  
You've got the love  
You've got the love  
You've got the love  
You've got the love  
You've got the love

You've got the love  
You've got the love  
You've got the love  
You've got the love  
You've got the love  
You've got the love

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air  
'Cause I know I can count on you  
Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord I just don't care"  
But you've got the love I need to see me through

This one is another very, very famous religous song is
"I Still Haven't Found What Im Looking For - U2" and the lyrics are......

### Lyrics

I have climbed highest mountains  
I have run through the fields  
Only to be with you  
Only to be with you  
I have run  
I have crawled  
I have scaled these city walls  
These city walls  
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips  
Felt the healing in her fingertips  
It burned like fire  
This burning desire

I have spoke with the tongue of angels  
I have held the hand of a devil  
It was warm in the night  
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I believe in the kingdom come  
Then all the colors will bleed into one  
Bleed into one  
But yes I'm still running

You broke the bonds  
And you loosed the chains  
Carried the cross  
Of my shame  
Oh my shame  
You know I believe it

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

#### What do you think the singer is looking for?

I think that the singer is seeking out happiness and to be one with God.
