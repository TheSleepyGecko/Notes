1. The **Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine** is responsible for agriculture in Ireland.
2. 43% of Ireland is covered in forest.
3. The European average forest coverage is 44.8%.
4. A forest composed of indigenous trees and not classified as forest plantation.
5. Some ways trees can help us are...
- Trees can give us oxygen to breath
-  They can allow animal life to thrive. 
- They can improve the soil quality. 
- They give us wood to make furniture.
- Fire to keep us warm.
6. Forestry can help create employment because when the government of a country decides to begin work in the forestry industry many jobs open up for planting, maintaining and cutting down trees which would also help the economy of the country
7. Woodland is managed in three sections 
**Planting**
>[!Info]
>Planting is when trees are planted in the nursery and are fenced in, and raised.

**Thinning**
> [!Info]
> Thinning happens for about 15 years periodically to allow space for other trees.

**Harvesting**
> [!Info]
> Harvesting normally happens when the trees are 30 - 50 years old.

8. The Netherlands has the least coverage at only 15% and Finland has the most forest coverage at 72.3%!
9. Tree thinning's can be used to make fuel or chipped and pulped to make manufactured boards.

1. Green timber is timber that is unseasoned and is damp
2. Equilibrium Moisture Content
3. Seasoning is drying out a piece of timber so that the moisture content is below 20%
4. Fungi do not attack timber, it is easier to work with, seasoning prevents the boards from spiltting.
5. So that the air can pass through and lower the moisture content of the wood.
6. 20%
7. How much of the timber is water normally expressed as a %
8. Slow drying rate, weather dependent, Large areas are used. Fungi do not attack, It is low cost, it is low energy.
9. Boards dry more quickly, different thicknesses of boards, lower moisture content available. Costly to set up, requires supervision, uses a lot of energy
10. Steam keeps the boards warm, Fans keep air circulating, Vents allow fresh air in, trolley moves the stack of wood, heating coils heat up the air and the boards, the stickers separate the boards so that air can pass through.
11. The stack of wood is elevated so that it can be seasoned evenly, and the air can circulate.
12. Air seasoned – 20%, Very sustainable, is very cheap, Kiln – 10%, Not very sustainable, very expensive.
