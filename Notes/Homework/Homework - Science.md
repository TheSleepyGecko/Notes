1. A benefit of using a microscope is that you can easily see things up very close.
2.  (i) The reason you cant use thick objects is that light wont be able to pass through and you will not be able to see the object. (ii) The object would appear black because no light would be able to pass through.

1. matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. There are three states of matter, solid, liquid and gas.
2. In a solid particles are packed tightly together. Therefore, solids have a definite shape. In a gas particles move around very quickly and there are large gaps between them. In a liquid, the particles can slide past each other. As a result, they have no definite shape.

#### 13.18
The temperature at which a solid turns into a liquid is called its melting point.

	19. Most solutions are made up of a substance called the Solute, which dissolves in the liquid called the solvent. Substances that dissolve are said to be soluble, while those who don't are insoluble. A cup of coffee is a solution, the hot water is the solvent and the coffee granules are the solute.
	20. A dilute solution has a low density of the solute and a concentrated solution has a high density of the solute.
	21. You would have to add more of the juice.
	22. Milk and salt.
	23. Examples:
		1. Chlorine in water.
		2. Coffee
		3. Oxygen causing rust.
	24. Explanation.
		1. A solution is the result of mixing the solute with the solvent.
		2. A saturated solution is where there is a huge amount of solute.

26. (a) I belive that there could not be any life on Venus or Mars because there are Extremly high temperatures on Venus and Extremely low temperatures on Mars. This is one reason that there could be no life on Mars or Venus. Another reason that there could be no life on Venus or Mars is that the distance from the sun on Mars is much farther away from the sun making days and nights longer making it more difficult for life to thrive. Venus on the other hand is much closer to the sun making the days extremly hot with little to no winter.

26. (b) We can see that diameter may be linked with gravity because in our example we can see that the numbers are extremely similar, we can back this up with further evidence that the more mass somthing has the stronger it's gravity will be and the bigger the diameter the more massive the object is (if it is a sphere).

1. Atherosclerosis is a heart disease which causes fatty material to build up in the artery walls, causing blood pressure to be higher and leading to a high risk of a heart attack.
2. Tobacco can decrease good cholesterol and increase bad cholesterol.
3. Carbon monoxide forces your heart to pump harder, possibly leading to a heart attack.
4. Nicotine produces adrenaline, forcing your heart to pump faster.

10. Digestion is the process of breaking down food so that your body can utilize it and dispose of it.

1. We digest our food so that we can dispose of it and so that we can use it to preform various function as well as energy.
2. When you eat food, your mouth is able to mechanically digest it by using your teeth and chemically dissolve it using your saliva. Then it will travel down your through to your stomach. Your stomach will use acid to dissolve it and churn to break it down further. Then the food will be transformed into glucose and brought into your bloodstream. Or disposed of in your rectum.

1. You do not only need to use your teeth because you must further break it down using enzymes, example. Stomach acid.
