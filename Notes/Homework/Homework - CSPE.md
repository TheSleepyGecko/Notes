### Rights Violations

1. In the first example we can see the violation of some of her basic human rights such as right of identity and she is being enslaved which violates her human rights because she is no longer free from slavery.

2. This is him violating his right of saftey and right to live. He is being deserted and is on his on which is why this is a violation of his  saftey.

3. This is an extreme violation of the right of freedom of thought, religion and belief. She is also being discriminated against because she is being treated differently for her opinions.

4. In this example she has lost her right to free speech, and she nearly lost her right to life.

If we did not have laws, there would be much more violence and disarray. Many people would leave their jobs to instead rob stores because it would be easier. People would also go homeless due to there being no laws.
