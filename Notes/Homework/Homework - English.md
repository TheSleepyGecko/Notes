## Diary entry

I am not quite sure what to do I just came home one day, it was a long day of work and was ready to relax and then suddenly it just happened, all at once. I do not know if I should be sad or happy or just even confused. I know that I need to help Molly, get her house back, I know she does not like her parents but they were her family and now she has lost them. I hope that she can settle down at our house and she will be happy with us, maybe she will feel like we are her family.

This may be the wrong decision but, I could leave work and look after Molly but we need money. I don't know what Tommo thinks I hope he is still ok. I think that I should divert all of my attention to Molly she should be my main priority. I just need to keep her safe make sure she is happy, has food and she is safe.

What will I do after the baby is born, should we move? What should we name it? Will it be a boy or a girl? I have so many questions, I wonder what Molly would want, I think that is the correct decision.  I just hope that everything will be ok.

1. The speaker talks very aggresively or even disrespecfully about his homework.
2. I think he feels this way because it is an inconvinience to him, his family or his friends.
3. I have a very similar opinion to homework as the speaker. I believe it should be changed or abandoned entirely.
4. I think that homework can help to give a better understanding of the topics learned while in school.

1. I think that this is a very memorable poem because it covers very relatable topics, made me think about things that I experience in my life every day and reconsider things I would not have thought about before.
2. Homework can be useful to fully test your level of understanding for a given subject or topic. It can also help to find weaknesses in your knowledge.

## Diary Entry

Dear Diary, the series of events I have just done through could only be described as unbelievable. One evening, mam was in the kitchen cooking dinner while Noah and I were outside. ‚ÄúDon't go far‚Äù is what she said to me right before me and Noah took off on the greatest journey of any 10 or 13-year-old. We hopped onto a train without being seen and snuck ourselves all the way to a ferry dock to go over to England. And just as we were about to hop on board, somebody stopped us and asked us where our parents are. We were scared and confused thinking that this was it, but we told him our parents were just behind us, and he let us on board. After we arrived in England, took another train and arrived at an airport, we just started following the crowd. Once we arrived at a gate, we asked somebody where the plane was going, and he simply told us it was heading to New York. So we thought that if we made it this far, why stop here. So we became stowaways on a plane, using the same trick as last time, until we had finally landed in New York. And that is how we managed to get to New York on our own!

1. The rugby players formed a scrum and then they diverse and one team went on to win the game.
2. I learned that in rugby, the two teams establish a scrum, and communication is essential.
3. It is humorous because of the actions and the accents.
4. I think it adds to the scene because we get to hear from all the characters, and it describes the scene better.
5. The actors could wear hats, wigs, change accents or change their posture.
7. I would add the sound of cheering because the audience would be excited. I would add the sound of players running because they would be running down the field. I would add the sound of a commentator commentating the match.

1. Snow, Barn, Clouds
2. Rustic, winter, cold
3. Somewhere in the countryside or farther up north.

1. I think that the poet does not like winter. We know it is winter because he talks about snow, clouds and when they say ‚Äúsometimes nature, is caught without their diadem‚Äù. This is referencing that nature can be bad, or not as good as it may seem. All of this tells us that they dislike winter.

Hugh Jackman is one of my favorite actors, and I was so excited about seeing The Greatest Showman mostly because it starred him and a bunch of good actors, I adore, including Michelle Williams, Zendaya, and Zac Efron. The Greatest Showman is inspired by the true story of PT Barnum, how he created the Barnum & Bailey. Circus and the lives of those involved. Hugh Jackman is such fun to watch, and he did a good job as PT Barnum. Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, Rebecca Ferguson and Zendaya all did great jobs with their roles and so did the supporting cast. Zendaya was the perfect actress for her role of Anne Wheeler. She looked so great, and I couldn't get enough of her. It was filmed and directed so well the music, which was choreographed so perfectly, made me happy.
The songs were very catchy. I couldn't stop listening to one song in my house, and that song was 'This Is Me'. Musicals are not my favourite type of movie, but when I saw The Greatest Showman, I was hooked. Yes, the plot may not match the true story, but it was amazing nonetheless. I was gripped from the beginning to the end. I loved the overall theme of acceptance, loving oneself and being content. It was a great film and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. If you want to go see a great movie, go and see The Greatest Showman.

- The movie is a sequel to the first escape room movie. In the first movie, a group of participants are faced with deadly escape rooms and were forced to try their hardest and work with their team to survive. The characters in this movie are faced with the trauma of their past experiences. A burning desire to find answers from the cruel game makers, who are they? Why are they doing this? This leads them to search for answers. They all end up getting caught up in the game again. The storyline then follows them where they must survive and escape deadly escape rooms as a team.

I liked the puzzles and the challenges, I think that they were all well written with intricate solutions. I liked all the group of characters and their skill sets, they were a good mix of different skill sets which all came into play at some stage during the movie. Furthermore, I also liked the overall storyline, It was intriguing, engaging, and unique. Directed by Adam Robitel. Starring Taylor Russell. Written by Maria Melnik. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 4/5 stars, this was a great physiological thriller and would definitely recommend this to anyone who has watched the first movie, likes puzzles or appreciates a good storyline.
