### Test answer

I am a Live Journalist, and I am in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, and I am currently reporting on a volcanic eruption. There is a village just down the hill from this volcano, the people are currently evacuating and there are emergency services on the way. Even if the volcano does not reach this village, they still can not return for a couple of weeks because of the pollution in the air. And if it does reach the village, it will be completely uninhabitable until the rock has been removed. All the farms in this area will also no longer be in use because of the pollution in the air, the crops will die, and the animals will have to be evacuated.

1. Mid-Atlantic ridges are created at constructive plate boundaries. When tectonic plates such as the Eurasian plate and North American plate move away from each other due to convection currents, magma from the mantle will flow upwards. If the magma reaches the surface and cools a volcanic island will be formed and if it cools near the sea floor a mid-Atlantic ridge is formed.

1. Volcanos can cause damage to local homes or infrastructure. This happens when a volcano erupts, launching falling rocks or hot lava, demolishing homes. Volcanos also ruin agriculture. Volcanos can create infertile soil, bad living conditions for animals or collapse of local ecosystems from the eruptions changing the state of the surrounding environment.

2. Volcanos can attract researchers from around the world to study them and set up facilities to study them better in the future. When this happens, more money can be brought into the economy from the foreign researchers. Tourism can also help boost the economy of areas in the proximity of dormant or extinct volcanos. This happens because tours or hikes are set up on top of the volcano.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock and is very common in Ireland, an example of this is skellig Michael. Limestone is formed whenever sediment(fish bones, rocks, and sand) located on the sea floor or on the bottom of a lake are compressed and cemented over an extremely long time, creating limestone. It can be white to dark gray in colour. Limestone is very commonly used in kitchens and roofs construction.

Granite is an igneous rock and is found near volcanos such as Mount Saint Hellens, it is made up of magma from active volcanos which has cooled down while underground. Granite is an intrusive rock which means that it cools while underground which allows bigger crystals to form because of the slower cooling compared to rocks that cool above ground.

1. Denudation is the process of breaking up and moving rocks in the Earth's surface.
2. Mechanical weathering is the physical breaking down of materials into smaller pieces.
3. Weathering is the breakdown and decay of rocks that are exposed to the weather.

1. A constructive wave is a wave where the swash is stronger than the backwash, this means that the wave will deposit its load.
2. A destructive wave is a wave where in which the backwash is stronger than the swash allowing the wave to carry a load from the beach.
3. Fetch is a principle that states that the farther the wave has to travel, the faster and more powerful it will become.

1. Waterfall
	A waterfall is a feature of erosion. When a river flows down a vertical slope and there is hard and soft rock, the soft rock will erode faster. The soft rock will erode by processes such as Hydraulic action and Abrasion. The area at the bottom of the waterfall is called the plunge pool. When the water enters the plunge pool, it splashes back and erodes the back wall. This is called the undercut. When the undercut becomes too large, the waterfall will collapse. Examples of waterfalls, include Niagara Falls and Powerscourt in Co. Wicklow.

2. Levee
	Levees are features of deposition. When there is a build up of alluvium and low flow, the load will be deposited when it floods. The load is deposited on the edge of the bank, this will build up a natural levee which will prevent flooding. Levees may sometimes be man-made as well. Examples include the river Liffey.

3. Sea Erosion Letter
	Dear Curtis Councillor
	I am suggesting that we build a sea wall. Our coastal area is currently under attack from sea erosion! This could be dangerous and lower revenue from tourism. A sea wall is a curved wall which can prevent sea erosion and protect our coast. When a wave hits the curved wall, it will be deflected back into the ocean, protecting the coast. A sea wall is cheap and effective, I hope that you could fulfil answer my request.

4. Bay and Headland
- A bay is a feature of erosion. When there is hard rock, soft rock and then hard rock again. Differential erosion will allow the soft rock to erode faster, this will create an indent in the cliff called a bay. The two parts of the cliff that juts out are called headlands. An example of a bay is Dublin bay.
