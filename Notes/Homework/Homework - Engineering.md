1. i) The purpose of the blast furnace is to refine the metals so that they can be used to make objects such as tools.
   ii) The charge consists of Iron ore, Coke, Limestone and Fluxes.
   iii) The blast furnaces work by first emptying the charge into a double bell system which allows the charge in but it does not allow heat to escape. After the charge has been melted it will flow out the lower exit in the blast furnace which will only allow pig iron out while the slag will float to the top.
2. In the diagram on the right there is a double bell system which allows the  charge to fall down below the first bell and then a gate closes and then the lower gate opens allowing the charge in but losing minimal heat.
3. i) The item A: is  known as the lance and is lowered in and sends oxygen into the furnace allowing it to heat up. Item B: is a fume collection hood. Item C: is the tapping spout.
  ii) The basic oxygen furnace works by placing the lance into the furnace, and tipping pig iron in trough the tapping spout, the lance allows oxygen into the furnace heating it up, the lance it cooled by water so that it does not melt. Once the iron has been melted it is tipped so that the iron can flow out and separated from the slag.

17. ![[Homework1.png]]
18. The wood is placed there so that the drill knows when to stop drilling.
19. A drill drift is used to eject tapered drill bits efficently.
20. A: Regular drill bit goes into the holder simply and is tightend B: Morse taper drill bit needs a tap to be inserted.
21. ![[Homework2.png]]
21. The point of it is to adapt the Morse taper drill bit for different sizes of drilling machines.
22. The material that is being cut and the material cutting.
23. 200 RPM/min
24. Drill feed is the speed the spindle is turning, it is reduced on certain materials to prevent shattering or other damage.
25. So that you know exactly where to drill.
26. A smaller hole to guide the final hole. A tapping hole allows you to thread the hole exactly to the correct size. A clearance hole is bigger than the thing going in to give it some leeway. A blind hole is when you drill, and you cannot see what you are drilling.
27. A countersink hole is where you bevel the rim of a drilled hole so that a screw can appear flush.
