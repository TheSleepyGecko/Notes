Stocks and dies - ``Stocks and dies are used for cutting external threads.`
Die nut - `I die nut is used for clearing the grooves of damaged or rusted threads.`

##### Faults that occur when screwing
| Fault                             | Causes                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Broken die teeth                  | Oversize bar, Jerking the Die, Not starting with chamfer side of die, Die not square with bar, Not reversing die.        |
| Stripped thread                   | Cut too heavy, Deepening of the cut after it has been started, Lack of cutting fluid, Not reversing die, Clogged flutes. |
| "Drunken" thread                  | Not starting square with bar.                                                                                            |
| Difficulty in starting die square | Uneven chamfer on bar, Broken teeth on starting side of die                                                              |
| Rough threads                     | Lack of cutting fluid, Cut too heavy, Clogged flutes                                                                                                                         |

### Types of screw threads

ISO Metric Threads - `This is an international screw thread system.`

Buttress Thread - `This thread is used for applying thrust in one direction only. It is used on the screws of quick release vices.`

Square Thread - `This thread is suitable for applying thrust in both directions. It is used on screw jacks, vices, clamps, vices, and spindles.`

Acme Thread - `The sloped flanks of this thread allow easy engagement of half nuts. It is used on the leadscrews of lath`

![[Types of screw threads.png]]

Coarse Threads - `Coarse threads are strong, have a large axial movement, but the core is weaker becuase it is smaller. The screy is more likely to work loose as a result of vibration.`

Threaded fasteners - `These include screws, bolts, studs and nuts.`

Screws - `Screws are used for joining parts together.`

### Bolts and nuts

Bolts - `Bolts are usually threaded only part of their length.`

Studs - `Studs are threaded at both ends.`

Nuts - `The thread on a nut must suit the bolt or stuf on which it is to be used.`

![[Types of nuts.png]]

Washers - `Plain washers prevent damage to the surface compenents when tightening nuts, bolts or screws.`

![[Washers.png]]

Locking plate - `It fits over the nut or screw head and is secured to the compenent by a small screw.`

![[Locking plate.png]]

Split pins - `Split pins are used to prevent castle and slotted nuts coming loose.`

![[Split pins.png]]

Spanners - `Spanners are used for tightening and loosening nuts, bolts and screws.`

![[Spanners.png]]

Combination pliers - `This is used for gripping flat or long objects and also for cutting wire.`

Gas pliers - `This is used for gripping round objects such as pipes and bars.`

Vice grips - `Objects can be gripped very securely with a vice grips.`

Screwdrivers - `There are two types of scredrivers, flat-ended and phillips.`

Allan key - `Allen keys are used for turning hexagonal socket head screws.`

Riveting - `Rivets are used for making permanent joints.`

### Riveting tools

Rivet snap - `This is used for finishing off a snap head after it has been rougly shaped with a ball pein hammer.`

Bolster or Dolly - `This is similar to the rivet snap, but is used for supporting the snap head of a rivet.`

Rivet set - `This is used to force the parts together before rivieting.`

Pop riveting - `Pop rivets are very useful for light work.`

Soft soldering - `Soft soliering is a method of making permanent type joints in metals.`

Fluxes - `Fluxes are used to remove oxides from the surfaces of the parts being soldered.`

Soldering irons - `Soldering irons are used for applying solder and heating the surfaces to be joined.`

Heating appliances - `Common heating appliences used for soldering are gas torches, soldering stoves, blow lamps and electric elements in the case of electric soldering irons.`

Cleaning the surfaces - `The surfaces must be cleaned mechanically before sodlering.`

Sweating - `When the joining is over large areas a method known as sweating can be used.`

Silver soldering - `Silver solders are mainly alloys of silver copper and zinc.`

Brazing - `Brass is the joining metal used in brazing.`

Spelter - `The brass used for brazing is called spelter.`

Brazing flux - `Different types of flux are used for brazing.`

The brazing hearth - `Brazing is usually carrioud out in a brazing hearth.`

Adhesives - `They can join similar or dissimlar materials.`
### Types of adhesive

![[Types of adhesives.png]]

Using adhesives - `The surfaces to be joined must be clean, dry, free of grease and close fitting.`
