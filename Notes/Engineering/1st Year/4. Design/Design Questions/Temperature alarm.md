Design and draw an electronic circuit that will sound an alarm when the temperature of a room gets too hot.

### Normal design without transistor.
![[Circut diagram 1.png]]

The problem with this design is that when it is nearly at a dangerous temperature, a trickle of electrons will flow through and sound the buzzer on low volume.

### Design with transistor

![[Circut diagram 2.png]]

This design removes that issue with the other design because when the trickle of electrons flows through the thermistor, it will not be enough to let electrons through the transistor.
