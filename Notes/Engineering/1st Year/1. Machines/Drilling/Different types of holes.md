When you need to drill a through hole(hole that goes all the way through the material) you must first make a pilot hole. A pilot hole is a smaller hole to guide the chisel bit into the material so that is very accurate. ~3 mm.

A clearance hole is a hole which is slightly bigger than the bolt or rivet being placed into it so that it fits smoothly.

A tapping sized hole is a hole in which the hole is smaller than the thread size you would like to create. e.g. ⌀4.2 mmm for an M5 thread. To put in the thread in this hole, you need to use a tap. The tap will eat away at the side until you have small teeth which allow you to thread in a bolt.

There are three taps in a set, the taper tap, the secondary tap and the plug tap. You must use them in that order to complete the hole. To use the tap you must first attach a tap handle and then turn it once, then move it backwards about 1 quarter of the diameter and then repeat.
