Pilot hole - `A smaller hole to guide a larger one.`
Clearance hole - `A hole larger than the what is being put into it to allow for extra room.`
Tapping sized hole - `A hole smaller than the thread being placed into it.`
Tap sizes - `There are three types of taps they have a decreasing number of tapered threads to tap a hole.`
Taper tap - `The first tap, with 8 - 10 threads.`
Second tap - `Used for blind holes and is tapered 4 threads.`
Plug tap - `Used at the bottom of a hole or a blind hole, has 1 - 2 threads.`
Tap - `The tool used to thread a hole.`
Tapping failures - `When tapping does not work and results in the threads not being tapped correctly.`

| Fault                          | Causes                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Broken tap                     | Tapping hole too small, Not reversing tap to break of chips, Tap not in alignment with hole, Not starting with taper tapm Attaching wrench while tap is in hole.                                       |
| Shallow Thread                 | Tapping hole too big.                                         |
| Stripped thread                | Not reversing tap, Tap flutes clogged, Lack of cutting fluid. |
| Rough thread                   | Lack of cutting fluid, Tap flutes clogged.                    |
| Bolt not square with work face | Hol not drilled square with work face.                                                              |


Shank - `The part of a drill bit which goes into the drill.`
Body - `The chiseled part of the drill bit.`
Flute - `The inside of the drill bit.`
Land - `The outside part of the drill bit.`
Morse taper drill bit - `A drill bit that can be inserted directly into the spindle.`
Reamers - `Used to drill a perfectly circular hole.`
Gearbox/pulley system - `Used to raise or lower the speed of the chuck.`
Chuck - `The part of the drill which holds the drill bit in place.`
Chuck guard - `A peice of plastic to protect the user of a drill from flying swarf.`
Feed - `The speed of the chuck.`

RPM - `Revolutions per minute`

### RPM Formula
```math
\mathrm{rpm} = \frac {r} {\mathrm{min}}
\mathrm{rpm}	=	revolutions per minute
r	=	revolutions
\mathrm{min}	=	minutes
