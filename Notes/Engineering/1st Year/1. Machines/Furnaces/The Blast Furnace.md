The blast furnace is a large pot with a lining called a refactory lining, before the iron ore is put into the blast furnace with coal dust(Coke) and limestone.

The Blast furnace uses a double bell system to allow the iron in but to trap the heat, there is also a ring around the blast furnace pumping in hot air to heat it up, once the iron comes out of the blast furnace in can go to the other furnaces.
