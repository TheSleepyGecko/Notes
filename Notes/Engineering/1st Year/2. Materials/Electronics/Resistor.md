### Resistors
Resistors are used to reduce or regulate current in a circuit. They can help to protect delicate components.

**Resistor** - `We use a colour chart to tell the resistance of the resistor(chart is on page 140). There are 4 colours. The gold will go on the left and you will then tell the resistance like this Colour1, Colour2, Colour3. THe third colour tells you how many zeros to put after the amount of ohms.

(for this example, that last one should be the same red as the others)

**Variable Resistor** - `This resistor can change the resistance level. The power comes through a wire into a long resistor. There is a moveable point of contact and a wire out. The farther away the point of contact the higher the resistance.`

**Light dependant resistor L.D.R** - `Resistance decreases as light shining on it increases. You can also get LDRs which are the opposite, Resistance increases as light shining on it increases.`

**Thermistor (Temperature dependent resistor)** - `Resistance in these will increase or decrease depending on which one you buy as heat increases.`
