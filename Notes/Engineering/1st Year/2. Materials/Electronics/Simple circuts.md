**Capacitor** - `Capacitors store electric charge. Capacitors charge up slowly and then can release a large amount of energy quickly. Example - Bright flash in a phone camera`

**Diodes and L.E.Ds** - `Diodes let current flow in one direction only, We need to do this to protect equipment sometimes. A band on the diode marks the negative side.`

` You can mix a diode with a bulb to get a light emitting diode. It will shine when current is going through it in the correct direction.`
