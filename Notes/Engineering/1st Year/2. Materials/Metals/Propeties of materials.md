## Hardness
Hardness is the ability to resist abrasive wear.
**Test:** Scratch it with a scriber.

## Ductility
Ductility is the ability of a material to be stretched without breaking.
**Test:** Pull it apart, see if it breaks.

## Malleability
A property of a material that allows it to be extended in all directions without breaking e.g. coins.
**Test:** Flatten in all directions with a hammer.

## Toughness
The ability of a material to withstand blows or an impact.
**Test:** Hit it with a hammer

## Brittleness
A Brittle material can be easily broken by an  impact. E.g. Glass or Acrylic
**Test:** Hit lightly with a hammer

## Elasticity
The property of a material to allow it to return to its original shape when freed from a force stretching it. E.g. rubber band.
**Test:** Pull apart and measure how long until it returns to its original shape.

## Conductivity
The ability of a material to allow heat or electricity to flow through it. E.g. steel, copper
**Test:** put a flame on one side and a thermometer on the other and see how quickly the temperature rises.
