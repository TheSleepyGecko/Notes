Plastics (Polymers) are a wide range of materials that come from crude oil. They have many properties and have wide-ranging usage cases.

Any plastic which you have will fall into one of two categories, thermoplastic or thermosetting plastic.

| Thermoplastic                                                           | Thermosetting plastic                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Thermoplastics can reheat and be reshaped/remolded many times. 💦 ↔️ 🧊 | Can only heat and mold once. 🥚 ↔️ 🍳 |

| Long chain molecules                                                    | Cross chain molecules                 |
