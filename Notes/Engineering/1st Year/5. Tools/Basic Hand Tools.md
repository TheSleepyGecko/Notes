- They are made of high carbon steel. The handle is knurled for extra grip. The point is ground to 30°. Scribers are used for etching into pieces of acrylic or metal.

### Engineer's Rule

- Zero starts at the very bottom. This is made from steel. The length is 300 mm. Used to mark and measure lengths. All the measurements on it are in mm.

### Tri Square

- Made from high carbon steel. Used to check 90° angles. The notch allows for extra burrs to fit in.

### The Bench Vice

- Made from high carbon steel. Saws are serrated for grip. We can use soft-jaws or fibre-jaws to clamp delicate pieces.

### Dividers

- A dividers is used to mark circles and arcs in materials. An adjusting nuts sets the distance between the spikes (radius).

### The Hand File

- The teeth can also be called serrations. It files down materials using the serrations. The hands are used to operate. The tang is inserted into the handle.

#### Different file profiles

### Hacksaw

- A hacksaw is used to cut materials. The blade is put under tension. The variable screw is used to fit the blade in place. The teeth will always face forwards.

### Ball pein hammer

- A ball pein hammer is used in engineering to shape materials and hit tools. The pein is a semi-spherical ball used to indent into the material.
