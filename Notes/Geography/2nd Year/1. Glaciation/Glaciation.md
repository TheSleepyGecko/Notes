- The term **moraine** describes the load of loose rock that **is transported,** and later **deposited**. **Lateral Moraines** are carried along the **side** of a glacier. **Medial Moraines** are formed when two Lateral Moraines **join together**.

- **Ground moraines** are carried along **beneath** the glacier. **Terminal Moraine:** Found at the **front of the glacier**, made up of material that is pushed ahead of the glacier. A terminal moraine marks the **end point** of the glacier.

- **Recessional Moraine:** A moraine making a **temporary stop** in the retreat (moving back) of a glacier. Stone materials are carried **inside the glacier** call **Englacial** and while others are **pushed ahead** of the glacier. 

- Landforms of the **Glacial deposition** are usually found in **lowland areas** where temperatures are **warmer** meaning the ice melts and is unable to transport its load anymore.

- **Boulder Clay Plains**, which are **lowland areas** that have been covered by a layer **of Boulder Clay** (mixture of stones, clay, and boulders). **Eskers** are long, **narrow ridges** made of sand and gravel.

- **Outwash Plains** are low, **flat areas** made of sand and gravel deposits. These are found in front of a **terminal morain**. **Erratics** are **large boulders** that were deposited by ice in an area where the **rock type** of the area is quite **different** to the rock type of the boulder.
