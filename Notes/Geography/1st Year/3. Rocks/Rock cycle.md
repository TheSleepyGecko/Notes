- Rock is the hard material that forms the Earth's crust. There are many different types of rocks. Rocks are divided into three groups according to how they are formed. Igneous, Metamorphic and sedimentary. Rocks are constantly changing and go through a cycle known as the Rock cycle.

#### Rock cycle.

- Magma rises from the mantle. Some can become trapped in the mantle. This cools slowly forming intrusive igneous rocks. The magma that reaches the surface cools quickly forming extrusive igneous rock.
- Rock on the Earths surface can be worn down over time. Some of these pieces of the rock can drop down to the bottom of the sea floor becoming pressed and cemented together, mixing with sea creatures forming sedimentary rocks.
- Metamorphic rocks are formed when igneous or sedimentary rocks are put under great heat or pressure. 
- This process is a cycle so it happens over and over again.
