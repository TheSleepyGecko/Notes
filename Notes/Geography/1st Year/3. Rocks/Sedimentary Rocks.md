- Sedimentary rocks are formed from the remains (sediment) of other rocks, plants and animals. These sediments are deposited on the beds of seas and lakes. They are then compressed and cemented together.
- Limestone and sandstone are examples of sedimentary rocks. Limestone is formed from the skeletons of tiny sea creatures, fish and shells on the sea floor. These particles are compressed and cemented together.
- Limestone varies from yellow to green colour and is found in the Burren Co. Clare.
- Sandstone is formed when large amounts of sand is deposited on the beds of seas and lakes. These deposits are compressed and cemented together to from sandstone. Sandstone varies in colour from brown to red and is found in the MacGillycuddy's Reeks in Munster.
