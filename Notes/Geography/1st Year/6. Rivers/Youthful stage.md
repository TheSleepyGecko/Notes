##### Youthful Stage: V Shaped Valleys
•	These are steep sided valleys with narrow floors. They are formed by:
1. As the river cuts vertically, its steep sides are attacked by erosion and this loosens up the rock and soil.
2. Gravity causes the loose material to flow downwards into the river, taking the material away. 
Example: Torc waterfall (Co. Kerry)

Examples of this are, Moy, Lee, Lifey.

##### Youthful Stage: Interlocking Spurs
•	Interlocking Spurs are a series of ridges that jut out on either side of the river and appear to lock into one another.
•	Examples can be seen in the Upper Course of the Aughnaleck valley, and in the Moy, Lee and Lifey rivers.

##### Youthful Stage: Waterfalls.
A waterfall occurs where a river flows over a vertical slope. 
1.	A River flows over an area where hard rock lies on top of an area of soft rock.
2.	The river erodes the soft rock faster. This develops a vertical drop where the hard rock and soft rock meet. This drop is called a waterfall.
3.	At the base, a plunge pool develops due to the force of the falling water, along with its load swirling around at the base, which wears away the base by abrasion.
4.	The rock above the plunge pool is undercut and left hanging. It eventually collapses into the plunge pool below. As this process continues, the waterfall slowly erodes its way upstream.
An example of a waterfall can be seen at Powerscourt, Co. Wicklow.
