##### Old Age Stage: Ox Bow Lakes
- Oxbow lakes are horseshoe-shaped lakes found on the flood plains of old rivers. They are formed by river meanders and the outer banks of the river. 
- Erosion by two meanders takes place on the outside bank of the meander. The neck of land between the meander begins to get narrower.
- During times of flood, the water has more energy. It takes the shortest route by breaking through the meander and begins to flow in a new, more direct course. 
- Deposits of alluvium now build up and cut off both ends of the meander. The old section of the meander is now separate from the main river and becomes known as an ox-bow lake. Over time, the lake may dry up.
- An example can be seen on the Mississippi River.

##### Old Ages Stage: Deltas
A delta is a triangular area of land found at the mouth of a river. It is a feature of the river Nile.
When a river reaches a lake or the sea, it slows down and loses the energy to carry sediment. 
The sediment is then dumped at the mouth of the river. Some rivers drop so much sediment that waves and tides can’t carry it all away. This forms the delta. 
The sediment builds up over time at the mouth of the river and limits the river’s entry to the sea. The river then has to erode through the delta in many small channels called distributaries.

##### Old Age Stage: Levees
A levee is a build-up of alluvium on the banks of a river and is a feature of the old stage river. 
During times of low flow in a river, the load that is being carried by the river is dropped onto the river bed. This raises the height of the bed.
During times of flood, the water flows out more easily over the top of the channel and onto the surrounding land. As it does this, it loses energy and deposits its load.
The heavy, coarse material is deposited on the river banks. The finer silt is deposited further away onto the flood plain.
After many floods, the river builds up a bank on either side.
Levees can be seen in the lower course of the River Liffey and the River Moy, Co. Mayo.
