Stages of a River
The Course of a River is broken into three stages.
1.	Upper Course (The Youthful stage)
2.	Middle Course (Mature Stage)
3.	Lower Course (Old Age stage)
â€¢	Each of these stages has different characteristics.

| Upper course                          | Middle course                       | Lower course                                     |
