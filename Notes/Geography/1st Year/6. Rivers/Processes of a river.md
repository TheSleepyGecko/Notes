The Processes of a River
•	There are three main processes of River erosion.
•	These are:
1.	Erosion
2.	Transport
3.	Deposition

##### River Erosion
• The River Erodes the landscape using many processes.
1. The fast moving water breaks and wears away material from the bed and banks of the river in a process known as hydraulic action.
2. This broken material is carried along the River and is known as the Load. This load is thrown against bed and bank, causing them to wear down. It is called abrasion.
3. The load is along worn down as it hits off each other and becomes smooth and rounded. This is called attrition.
4. The water can also dissolve some minerals, e.g. Limestone on the bed and bank. This is called solution.

##### River Transportation 
As a river moves from the source to the sea, it transports its load. The load is transported in a number of ways by the river.

1. Large boulders and stones are rolled along the river bed by the force of the water. This method is known as traction.
2. Small pebbles are bounced along the river bed. This method is known as saltation.
3. Tiny particles are held in suspension in the water – the movement of water is fast enough to keep them from dropping to the river bed.
4.	Dissolved minerals like limestone are carried in the solution – it cannot be seen.

##### River Deposition
•	Rivers deposit their load when they begin to lose speed and has less energy. 
•	This happens:
1.	When a river reaches the old stage.
2.	When a river enters a flat, gentle plain or the sea.
3.	At the bend of a meander.
