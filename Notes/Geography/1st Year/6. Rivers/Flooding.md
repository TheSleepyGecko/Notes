##### Case Study: Flooding on the River Shannon
- Some flooding now occurs every winter and for some period every second summer on average. 
- This is as a result of the river having a very gentle gradient, so water is slow to leave the channel.
- The river channel is also both narrow and shallow in places, leading to increased risk of flooding.
- The huge floodplains are barely above normal water levels in places. Construction took place on these low floodplains, leading to these buildings being very vulnerable to flooding. 
- In 2015, the worst flooding ever experienced along the Shannon took place in December 2015 and January 2016.
- 400 homes were abandoned after being flooded, with another 150 home being marooned and cut off by floodwaters.
- Shops were also flooded and stock destroyed.
- The cost of repairing the damage caused by the floods was more 100 million euro.

2.	Without a good road network, rivers provided them with suitable transport routes via boats and ships.
3.	Rivers could offer protection, acting as defensive moats around their castle.
