##### Mature Stage: Wide Valley
- In the mature stage of a river, erosion occurs laterally (sideways) rather than vertically (downwards).
- This creates a wide valley that is not very steep.
- Interlocking spurs have been removed by lateral erosion, which widens the valley floor.
- Erosion and mass movement have also made the valley sides less steep.

##### Mature Stage: Flood Plains P.96
- A flood plain is the flat area of land on either side of a mature/old river.
- The river can become swollen and overflow its banks after a period of heavy rain.
- As the overflow water spreads over the level land, it quickly loses its energy and deposits its load of alluvium(very fine clay).
- Over many periods of flooding, a thick layer of alluvium builds up to form the floodplain.
Examples of Floodplains include the River Shannon and River Lifey.

##### Mature Stage: Meanders are formed by a combination of erosion and deposition in the mature and old age stages of a river.

- Water flows more quickly on the outside of the river bend. The river erodes the bend by a combination of hydraulic action and abrasion.
- Water flows more slowly on the inside bend of the river. Material is deposited on the inside bend as the river loses energy here.
- An example of a meander can be seen in the middle and lower course of the Rivers Shannon and Boyne.
