##### Rivers and Human Interaction
People interact with two main aspects of Rivers Processes.
1.	People try to modify and change the course of rivers to suit human needs.
2.	People also influence floodplains. People’s activities play a part in flooding of land and homes.

##### Human Interaction with the Flow of the River: Dams
•	A dam is a barrier that is built across a river to limit the flow of water.
•	They are usually built to store water in a reservoir or artificial lake. This is used for irrigation, recreation, and water supply for surrounding households and businesses.
•	The water can also be directed through turbines in the dam to generate Hydro Electric Power(HEP).
•	Dams can cause problems, though. Alluvium that would normally be deposited in the lower stage of the river, will be deposited behind the Dam. These leads to soils further downstream losing a source of fertility.

##### Human Interaction with the Flooding of the River
•	Flooding is a natural process that happens regularly, especially after heavy rainfall, mainly in the lower course of the river.
•	One method to prevent flooding is building Levees. These, sometimes natural levees, are raised by river engineers by adding soil or rocks to the top.
•	However, sometimes the force against levees can become so great they can collapse, causing severe flooding.
•	Natural ways of slowing down flooding involves planting trees and vegetation. However, due to deforestation, the rate of flooding can rapidly increase.
•	Another way that people can increase the problem of flooding is by removing vegetation. This increases the risk of flooding.
