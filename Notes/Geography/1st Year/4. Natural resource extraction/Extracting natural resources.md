### Drilling
- This involves boring down into the earths crust on land or sea to extract oil or gas. Onshore oil spills can cause damage to the local environment. Huge amounts of economic profit can be gained from drilling e.g. Corrib Oil and Gas field which at full production could produce up to 60% of Ireland's Gas needs.

### Quarrying
- This involves the removal of rocks, sand and gravel or minerals from the ground near the surface of the Earth. Quarrying causes air, noise and visual pollution. Quarrying has many positives for the economy such as job creation and also generates oer $1 Billion for the Irish economy each year.

### Shaft mining
- This is the process of drilling vertically into the earth gaining  access to mineral beneath the surface e.g. Coal and Zinc. Large amounts of dust become airborne which can cause health problems for people in the surrounding area. This industry creates large amounts of jobs e.g. Tara mine with 730 jobs.
