| **Even Slope** | ![[Even Slope.png]] |
| The Contuors are evenly spread |The increase is gradual |
| **Concave Slope** | ![[Concave Slope.png]] |
| The Contours begin to by being widely spaced apart, then become closer and closer | |
| This means the slope is gentle at first and then becomes quite steep | |
| **Convex** | ![[Convex Slope.png]] |
| The contours are closely spaced at the start and gradually become more widley spacd at the top. | |
| The slope is very steep at its base and evens out at its peak | |
| **Concave Slope** |  |
| This slope is a combination of concave and convex slopes | ![[Concave Slope2.png]] |
