A **volcanologist** is a scientist who studies volcanoes.

They study **volcanic material**, monitor **changes in the shape** of a volcano and try to **predict eruptions** and explain **why they erupt** where they do.

### Volcanic Mountains

**Volcanic mountains** are formed when molten magma erupts through a **hole in the crust** called a **Vent**.

As the **magma** is under great **Pressure** in the mantle, many eruptions are **Violent**.

When the magma reaches the **surface** it is known as **Lava**. Layers of lava build up around the vent, where it **cools** and **hardens**.

As this builds up, it forms a **volcanic cone**.

The lava continues to spill out of the volcano through an opening called a **Crater**.

Other materials such as **gas**, **ash**, **steam**, **rocks** and **boiling mud** can escape during an eruption.
