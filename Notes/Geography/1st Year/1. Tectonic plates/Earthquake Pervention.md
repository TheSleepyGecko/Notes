## Predicting Earthquakes.

**Predicting earthquakes** is hard however there are some ways of checking the chances of an earthquake including,

-  **Laser beams** can be used to **detect plate movement**.
-  A **Seismograph** can be sued to pick up advance vibrations in the crust.

More important than prediction is **preparing** people and buildings who live in earthquake zones. These include,

-  Holding **Earthquake Drills** to practice what to do during an earthquake.
- Earthquake proofing of buildings by **heavy furniture** being **to the walls**, having **rubber shock absorbers** in the foundations and **reinforcing concrete structures with steel**.
