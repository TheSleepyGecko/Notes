- A **tsunami** is a huge or series of waves.

- These are usually as a result of an **underearth quake or, sometimes Volcanic eruption**.

-  When the **ocean** **floor** at a plate boundary rises or falls suddenly, it displaces the water above it and starts the **rolling waves** that grow to become a **Tsunami**.

-  Tsunami’s can have **devastating effects** to coastal areas such a **death** and **destruction** of towns and villages.
