- Ireland has a varied coastline. A basic difference can be seen between westerly shores that are exposed to the full force of the Atlantic Ocean and the more sheltered east coast.
- The sea is constantly shaping out the coastline with waves eroding, depositing and transporting material along the coast. Waves and their size are influenced by the strength of the wind and the length of the sea it has to pass over (fetch).

- There are generally two types of waves.

1. A destructive wave, which is one where the backwash is stronger than the swash and material is eroded.
2. A constructive wave is one where the swash is stronger than the backwash and material is deposited.
