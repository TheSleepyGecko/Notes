- Waves erode by four processes. These are:

1. **Hydraulic Action:** The power of water as it crashes against the coast
2. **Abrasion:** Waves pick up stones and throw them against the coast, which abrade the coast.
3. **Attrition:** Stones carried by the waves hit off each other. Over time, they are worn down and smoothened.
4. **Solution:** Certain rocks, such as limestone, are dissolved by the water.
