A build-up of sand and other small rocks or debris as a result of deposition from changing 
tide levels.

- When waves crash against the shore, the swash carries a load of sand and other small or fine rocks. When the wave rocks up onto the shore, it will deposit some of its load. The backwash is not as strong as the swash and is unable to carry away the larger rocks or clumps of sand.
- This creates different concentration of sand, finer sand closer to the sea and more rough sand further away from the ocean.
- During extreme weather, something called a storm beach can form. Storm beaches are beaches in which the swash is much stronger due to the storm throwing large rocks or debris onto the beach.

**Examples:** Greystones, Co Wicklow Tramore, Co. Waterford
