- Material carried by the sea (sand, silt, mud, pebbles) is known as its load.
- The process that this load is transported along the coast is called Longshore Drift.

1. The Waves approach the shore at an angle.
2. The swash moves material up the shore and deposits some of it here.
3. The backwash brings some material straight out, following the slope of the beach.
4. The processes are repeated over time, moving material along the shore in a zigzag way.
