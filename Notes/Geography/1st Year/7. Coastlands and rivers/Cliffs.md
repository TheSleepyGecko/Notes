- A cliff is a vertical or steep slope on the coast. Destructive waves attack and erode a notch at the base of the cliff by hydraulic action, abrasion and compressed air.
- When the notch becomes deeper, the soft rock will collapse under its own weight, forming a sea cliff.
- The notch continues to erode, so that the cliff continues to retreat slowly into the coast. As the cliff retreats, an almost flat, rocky area is created on the shore. This is called a wave-cut platform, is usually visible at low tide. 
- Examples include the Cliffs of Moher in Co. clare and the Slieve league in Co. Donegal.
