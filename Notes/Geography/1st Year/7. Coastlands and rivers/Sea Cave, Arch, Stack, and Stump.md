- Strong waves attack cracks and weakness in the base of a cliff. Through hydraulic action, abrasion and compressed air, they erode a large hole at the foot of the cliff. This continues over thousands of years. The hole is known as a sea cave.

- If a sea cave erodes all the way through the headland (or if two caves erode, back to back), a sea arch will form. This is an archway straight through the headland. If the roof of the arch collapses, a pillar of rock will remain standing alone in the sea. This pillar is known as a sea stack.

- If over time the sea stack collapses into the sea, all that remains is a small stump of rock. This is known as a sea stump.

### Blowhole

- A blowhole is a passage that goes through the roof of a ave to the land surface above. Blowholes are formed when waves compress air that breaks a hole through the roof of the cave.
