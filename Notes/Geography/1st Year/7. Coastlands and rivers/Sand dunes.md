Sand dunes are hills of sand that build up on the shore beyond the high-tide mark at the back of the beach.
1. Winds from the sea dry the sand on the beach, making it lighter.
2. The wind blows the dry sand inland until it is trapped by a wall of vegetation.
3. The sand piles up to form low hills or dunes. Sometimes Marram grass is planted on the dunes to prevent further blowing away of sand.
**Examples include:** Rosslare Co. Wexford, and Tramore Co. Waterford

## Sand spit, sand bar and tombolo

- A sand spit is a narrow ridge of sand or shingle that is connected to the land on one end and just out to sea on the other.

1. Long shore drift losses energy when a sheltered bay interrupts it.
2. The material carried by longshore drift is then deposited.
3. These deposits build up over time to gradually form a spit.
4. The spit extends across the bay. As it increases in size, vegetation grows on it.
5. A spit can grow in size until it completely seals off a bay. This is called a sandbar. A lagoon is a small lake that is formed behind the sandbar.
6. A tombolo is a narrow ridge of sand or shingle that joins an offshore island to the mainland.

**Examples:** Sand spit: Inch Co. Kerry Sand Bar: Our Lady's Island Co. Wexford Tombola: Howth Co. Dublin
