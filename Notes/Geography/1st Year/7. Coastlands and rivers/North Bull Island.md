- North Bull Island is located in Dublin Bay. It exists as a result of coastal decisions made over  200 years ago. In the nineteenth century, longshore drift was carrying large amounts of sand and silt into Dublin Bay.
- The deposits were partially blocking up the mouth of the harbour, making it difficult for ships to enter.  After a survey, it was decided that walls would be built on both sides of Dublin Harbour.
- The North wall was completed in 1821. Longshore drift now deposited material behind the North Bull wall. This helped to build a large sand spit, which developed into North Bull Island.
