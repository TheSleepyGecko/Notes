- Bays and headlands are formed on coastlines where an area of soft rock is eroded quicker than the hard rock in the headland. This is known as differential erosion. Soft ruck, such as sandstone, is more easily eroded and begins to form a hollow in the coast known as a bay.
- The area of hard rock, such as granite, is left jutting out on either side into the sea. This is called the headland. Examples include Dublin Bay and Liscannor Bay, Co. Clare.
