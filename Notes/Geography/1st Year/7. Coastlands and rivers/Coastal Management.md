- Humans have put measures in place to protect their coasts from the powerful processes of sea erosion.
1. **Groynes** are concrete or wooden walls or fences that are built out into the sea at the right angles to the coast in order to disrupt/stop longshore drift.
2. **Sea walls** are built to break the power of the incoming waves. They are curved at the top to push the waves back out to sea.
3. **Gabions** are steel wire cages filled with stones. They are then stacked on top of each other where they act like a sea wall. This is done to slow down or prevent erosion by breaking the power of the waves.
4. **Rock armour** are large boulders placed at the base of soft cliffs or in front of Sand Dunes to reduce the erosive power of the waves.
