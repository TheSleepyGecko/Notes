As the river flows underground, the carbonic acid in the water dissolves limestone and cuts out a long passage called a cage. If the cave gets long enough, it can create a large chamber called a cavern. Water containing dissolved limestone seeps through the limestone into the cave/cavern. Some of these drops hang from the roof.

When some water evaporates, it leaves behind deposits of calcite attached to the ceiling. These build up overtime, creating icicle like shapes called stalactites that hang from the ceiling. When some of these drops fall onto the cave floor, it leaves behind small amounts of calcite on the floor. This builds up over time to create a cone-shaped feature called stalagmites. As stalactites and stalagmites grow, they can join up to create a pillar.
