- Mechanical weathering is the physical breaking down into smaller pieces. The most common types of this is Freeze Thaw Action/Onion Erosion.
	1. Water gathers in cracks in the rock during the day.
	2. At night, when the temperatures fall below freezing, the water freezes and expands in the crack by up to 10% putting pressure on the rock. This then thaws during the day.
	3. Repeated freezing and thawing results in the rocks becoming weak and breaking into smaller pieces, known as scree.
