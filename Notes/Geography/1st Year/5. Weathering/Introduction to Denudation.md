- Denudation is the process of breaking up and moving the rocks on the Earth's surface. The three main processes of Denudation are, weathering, mass movement and erosion. Weathering is the breakdown and decay of rocks that are exposed to the weather.

- The two main types of weathering are mechanical weathering and chemical weathering. Mass movement is the movement of loose material, called regolith, down a slope due to gravity. 

- There are two different speeds of mass movement, slow (Soil Creep) and fast (Landslide, etc.). Erosion is the weathering away of the rocks and the removal of this material. Erosion is caused by moving water, moving ice or moving air.
