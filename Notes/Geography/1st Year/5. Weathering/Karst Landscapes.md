- Karst landscapes are areas of land made up of limestone. In these areas, overlying soil and plants are removed, with bare limestone being left exposed to the surface. An example of a karst area is the Burren Co. Clare. The effects of carbonation are best seen in karst areas in both the surface and underground features.

The exposed limestone is called a limestone pavement. This is made of Clints and Grikes. Clints are the slabs of rock of the surface that separate the Grikes. Grikes are deep grooves in the pavement between Clints. These get deeper and wider due to carbonation.

These areas can be flat or can contain sloping terraces. When a river enters a karst landscape, it can disappear underground through grikes. When these enlarge through carbonation, they can form swallow holes.
