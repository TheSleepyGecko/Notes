- Chemical weathering is caused by chemical changes, when rock is dissolved or decays. One major example of chemical weathering is Carbonation.

	1. As rain water falls and passes through the air, it dissolves carbon dioxide.
	2. Carbon dioxide mixes with the rainwater to form a weak carbonic acid.
	3. Limestone in the ground contains calcium carbonate, which is vulnerable to weak carbonic acids.
	4. When the acid makes contact with the limestone, a chemical reaction takes place and the calcium carbonate in the limestone begins to dissolve, this is called carbonation.
	5. Limestone is a permeable rock, which means that rainwater can easily pass through it, dissolving it further.
