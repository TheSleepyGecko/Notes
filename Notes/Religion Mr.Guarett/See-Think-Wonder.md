### See
In the image I see a man stuck high up in a tree. Many people are passing by while one person is pointing at him.

### Think
I think that he got himself stuck in a tree but everybody is just passing by and not bothering to help him, but one person is pointing him out and the other people just continue to ignore him.

### Wonder
I wonder if the one person pointing ar him is trying to help him get down, but nobody else will help to save the person that seems to be stuck high up in a tree.

### Table fellowship
- Table fellowship means being open to all people who want to be part of the kingdom of God.
- Jesus gave his time to all people. He shared meals with even the social outcasts. The Kingdom of God is open to all.

#### What do you see in the picture that caused amongst Simon and the other guests?
I think Simon and the other guests would be in utter shock from the act of unexpected kindness that Jesus had preformed, but they would have appreciated it and taken it as an example after they had come over the initial shock.

#### Imagine what happened in the women's life (Diary Entry)
**Dear Diary:**
It is my birthday today but nobody knows, my family is still sleeping inside on their warm beds while I'm out here in the cold with only rags to keep my warm. God please help me, I need you blessing...

#### Who do you think failed to show good manners.
I think that Simon failed to show good manners in this situation because he should have accepted the women and he also should have realised that she could have been through a lot.
